# 'The Satanic Verses': The long road to German publication

https://www.dw.com/en/the-satanic-verses-the-long-road-to-german-publication/a-63276797
<blockquote>
When Salman Rushdie's fourth novel, "The Satanic Verses," appeared in its English-language first edition on September 26, 1988, the writer could not yet have imagined that this book would fundamentally change his life. "The Satanic Verses" in German "The fatwa led to paralysis in the publishing house," Helge Malchow, editor at the time and later publishing director, told DW. "I thought it was a crime not to publish the book," he said. German writer Hans Magnus Enzensberger turned to Widmann's friend Frank Berberich, publisher of the culture magazine Lettre International. "I thought it was a crime not to publish the book," Arno Widmann said After the Turkish writer Aziz Nesin announced that he would publish excerpts from Rushdie's book, Islamists carried out an arson attack on a culture festival in 1993 because Nesin was scheduled to be there. Back in 1989, about 100 publishing houses, writers' associations, editors and authors got together to found a new publishing house that would publish "The Satanic Verses" in German. The Article 19 publishing house, whose name refers to the freedom of expression in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, served the sole purpose of publishing Rushdie's novel. Bernhard Robben, who later translated several of Rushdie's works into German, told DW that, as much as he would have liked to translate the book, he struggled with the idea of living "in fear of death." Robben was living in Oxford at the time and he and Rushdie met and got along well. It was unthinkable to him that this book would not be published in German and that the attack on freedom of expression would succeed. Bernhard Robben, who co-translated "Joseph Anton," is in fact "pretty sure it wouldn't be published today."

# England's WSL: Is it living up to the hype?

https://www.dw.com/en/englands-wsl-is-it-living-up-to-the-hype/a-63286432
<blockquote>
But now these are the people that are interested in watching, those people are fans of the game and they will come to watch us again and again and again, I hope," she told DW, before striking a slightly more cautious note. I question it because it has to be fixture-friendly with the men's team and there's a lot of things [to fall in to place for] a day like today." But a somewhat unforeseen effect of affordable tickets and increased demand has been empty seats at sold out games. Though several WSL clubs have sold out their season tickets for games that are, for the most part, at much smaller stadiums, there is a suggestion that some fans buy them to secure a few key games in a season and won't necessarily attend every match. "I think we've now entered that phase of women's football becoming a business," said the head coach of WSL champions Chelsea, Emma Hayes, after the Euros win. "The next step is the league leaving the FA and going to the Premier League or an independent body and that there is a vision around the women's game so we don't just have single big moments – single events once every two years or once a year – that they're every week." For now though, with the exception of a handful of clubs in Spain, France and Germany, it's clear the combination of money, better facilities and bigger crowds have made the WSL the destination of choice for the world's best players. "We can now start pushing in that competition as a league, WSL, in the Champions League," said Williamson to DW before Arsenal snuck past Ajax and in to the group stage. "And from our perspective that's where we should be."

# Trump requests Supreme Court intervene in Mar-a-Lago case

On Tuesday, Trump's lawyers filed a request with the Supreme Court to overturn a previous ruling from the Court of Appeals that prevented an independent arbiter requested by Trump, known as a special master, from vetting more than 100 classified documents that were among 11,000 records seized by FBI agents. "Since [former] President Trump had absolute authority over classification decisions during his presidency, the current status of any disputed document cannot possibly be determined solely by reference to the markings on that document," Trump's lawyers said in the filing on Tuesday.

# Depeche Mode to release new album and go on world tour

<blockquote>
The band's remaining permanent members, guitarist and keyboardist Martin Gore and lead singer Dave Gahan, announced in Berlin on October 4 that they will release a new album "towards the end of March" and embark on a world tour. Yet, in their early years, the band was dismissed as synth-pop pinups: a boy band that was unlikely to last. Depeche Mode then went on to sell more than 100 million albums, winning over a global audience with hit singles such as "Personal Jesus," "People Are People" or "Enjoy The Silence." Depeche Mode Speaking to an NME journalist in West Germany in 1984, Andy Fletcher said: "The last time we refused an interview with them, they made up a story about Dave having to be carried off stage at the end of every performance, taken to a separate dressing room and kept supplied with constant fluids. "It sometimes feels a bit strange to be able to do this," Gahan said, "but to be able to walk on a stage and bring some joy to a lot of people is something that we are pretty proud of.” "For sure he'll be there in spirit — or, you know, judging us," Gahan laughed.

# Taiwan: Does Germany parliamentary visit risk antagonizing China?

https://www.dw.com/en/taiwan-does-germany-parliamentary-visit-risk-antagonizing-china/a-63329462
<blockquote>
"We do not consider it acceptable that you are threatened by a neighbor with military force, to be forced into unwanted cooperation," he said. However, analyst Barkin said there is a risk that Germany is unprepared for the fallout of a conflict in the Taiwan Strait. "But there is a risk that Germany is just as unprepared for a conflict in the Taiwan Strait as it was for Vladimir Putin's invasion. There is a lot more work to do at the national and European levels to prepare for Taiwan scenarios," he added. The German delegation's visit this week carries both symbolic importance and substance, said Marcin Jerzewski, head of the Taiwan Office of the Center for European Values, the EU's official representation in Taiwan. "The fact that the German delegation coming to Taiwan is a cross-partisan delegation sends a message that it is normal to engage with Taiwan and it is normal to foster people-to-people relations because this is inherently what parliamentary delegations do," he added. "While the lawmakers don't represent the German government's official position, the cross-partisan nature of the delegation shows there is cross-party support for Taiwan in the German parliament." During the remainder of the trip, the German delegation is expected to visit Taiwan's parliament, hold meetings with local security think tanks and visit Tainan Science Park in the southern part of the island.

# European farmers struggle to contain deadly bird flu

https://www.dw.com/en/european-farmers-struggle-to-contain-deadly-bird-flu/a-63302531
<blockquote>
Poultry farmer Alrik Visscher from Dalfsen in the eastern part of the Netherlands is one of the farmers who has lost all his birds because of the flu. There have been regular outbreaks of this sickness, which is deadly for many birds, for more than year, though normally, the bird flu season in Europe lasts from October until April or May. In the Netherlands alone, more than 4 million chickens and ducks had to be culled, while hundreds of thousands wild birds have died. Barely any European country escaped cases of bird flu among wild birds or poultry since the beginning of this season in October 2021. Just like in the Netherlands, where the density of poultry farms is among the highest in Europe. According to the EFSA, high poultry density is one of the factors leading to a faster spread of the virus, which usually comes from Asia via migratory wild birds spending the winter in Europe. A positive test at one farm leads to the installation of a 3-kilometer-wide-protection zone in which all farms have to prove they have no bird flu – and at affected farms all birds are culled as the virus is highly infectious. Measures like quarantines and early cullings of animals on the farms can lower the threat of a spread – but they cannot contain it completely. The only hope among bird conservationists and farmers is now: A vast spread of the virus leading to a high immunity among the local birds. New hygiene measures are to be announced; only then can new birds arrive.

# What does the Nord Stream pipeline gas leak mean for the environment?

https://www.dw.com/en/what-does-the-nord-stream-pipeline-gas-leak-mean-for-the-environment/a-63268348
<blockquote>
The gas from the Nord Stream pipeline leaks would have been burned for energy use regardless of the leak, so it is unlikely that more emissions were released than normal. Research has found that methane emissions are 80 times worse than carbon dioxide emissions over a 20 year scale — and that they already account for roughly 30% of global warming. Human activity over the past 150 years has prompted a huge rise in artificial greenhouse gas emissions, causing global temperatures to soar at an alarming rate. Data show that the impact of a man-made climate crisis from greenhouse gas emissions is already being felt around the world — including in Germany. At the UN global climate conference COP26 late last year, more than 100 nations pledged to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030. Nord Stream 1 and 2 are now shut down indefinitely because of the leaks — but many countries in Europe, including Germany, rely on these gas pipelines for energy.

# Methane gas: What's the big deal?

https://www.dw.com/en/methane-gas-whats-the-big-deal/a-59059353
<blockquote>
While the gas, also known as CH4, has become almost synonymous with cattle flatulence, there's actually much more to it than that. Scientists estimate that although methane only accounts for 3% of emissions since 1750, it is linked to as much as 23% of historic warming. In other words, the stuff is potent. Partly, but not only, as a result of gassy livestock, the agricultural sector causes the same amount of warming as 788 million cars, which is more than half of the world's 1.4 billion-strong fleet. And what's more, the natural gas saved from patching up the leaks would more than pay for the upgrades. And at least we can use methane to burn. Not when we could be talking permafrost. Thing is, as the Arctic heats up, areas of Earth that have been locked in frozen slumber for many millennia, are starting to thaw. Some of this former icescape then transforms into new wetlands, which release methane into the atmosphere, helping temperatures to rise. Thawing permafrost could increase non-human methane emissions by 80%. But even as individuals we can make a contribution by (whether we like it or not), cutting back on burgers, palm oil and flying. But that, we have seen by now, is the one thing the planet cannot afford to let happen.

Observers had commented in recent weeks that Musk appeared to be facing an uphill battle convincing the Delaware court that core information about Twitter had changed sufficiently since April to justify calling off the transaction. "On the legal merits, his case didn't look that strong," Talley told AP.

# Opinion: Lula's rhetoric also threatens Brazilian democracy

https://www.dw.com/en/opinion-lulas-rhetoric-also-threatens-brazilian-democracy/a-63303021
<blockquote>
One that is not too dissimilar to that of right-wing populist President Jair Bolsonaro, who claims Brazil faces a rigged election — an accusation for which he has presented no evidence. While Bolsonaro and is wife Michelle claim they must protect Brazil from demons, the devil and Communism, and accuse Lula of being a thief, Lula says the country faces the danger of fascism, the Ku Klux Klan, and illiberalism. Both figures' dismal track records explain why this election campaign has been accompanied by such shrill populist rhetoric. After four years under the inept leadership of Bolsonaro, Brazilian society finds itself in crisis. And his decision to have Brazil host the football world cup and Olympic games, while the country's hospitals and schools fell into disrepair, caused severe economic problems and social tensions. Additionally, the piece stated President Bolsonaro came to power following a 2019 election — the vote where he was elected president took place in 2018 and he assumed office on January 1, 2019.

# New film shows why Marilyn Monroe was so much more than a sex symbol

https://www.dw.com/en/new-film-shows-why-marilyn-monroe-was-so-much-more-than-a-sex-symbol/a-57721834
<blockquote>
More often labeled "blonde bombshell" or "sex symbol," she actually bucked some of the social trends of the mid-20th century that still strike a chord today  — and that is 60 years after she succumbed to a barbiturate overdose on August 5, 1962. Having premiered at the 2022 Venice Film Festival and been released in cinemas in the US on September 16 and in the UK on September 23, many critics have already celebrated the film, and especially the performance of the lead, Cuban-born Ana de Armas. Actress Ana de Armas was lauded for her portrayal of Monroe Professionally, her come-hither looks, breathy voice — a strategy suggested by a speech therapist to overcome a stutter — and the sexuality-driven roles she landed, reduced her to a two dimensional character that pandered primarily to male fantasies. The film depicts the actress's fraught relationships with the men in her life Originally held up as an example of why feminism was necessary to counter the sexual exploitation and objectification of women, she has since been recognized for her own demands for self-determination. Meanwhile, she was unabashed about her curves and embraced her sexuality in a way once seen as the antithesis of feminism. One of her most-mentioned acts of awareness was when she used her celebrity to enable jazz star Ella Fitzgerald to perform at a club that originally refused to hire her. This is an updated version of an article that was originally published on August 4, 2022.

# Burkina Faso: Is the recent coup a boon for Russia?

"It's what has resulted or culminated in the coups we are witnessing, particularly in Mali and Burkina Faso," Adib added. He added that France and other Western partners seem to be becoming unpopular and that governments in the region are looking to ignite relationships with countries that they believe will bring a new dynamic. "We are supposed to be partners in this, but when there are cracks, when there are divisions, it plays to the advantage of the terrorists," Adib said.

Hardly anyone is asking her advice on the worrying state of world affairs, presumably also because one cannot help feel she left her successor Olaf Scholz, of the Social Democrats, and his coalition government to sort out a big mess when she left.

And in 2015, she kindly opened German borders to refugees, mainly of them Syrian, yet failed to work out how to better manage long-term immigration. These care-free times, after all, are over. Speaking at the opening of the Helmut Kohl Foundation in Berlin this week, she said one must take Putinseriously, and think about what will follow when the war ends.

# New film shows why Marilyn Monroe was so much more than a sex symbol

https://www.dw.com/en/new-film-shows-why-marilyn-monroe-was-so-much-more-than-a-sex-symbol/a-57721834
<blockquote>
More often labeled "blonde bombshell" or "sex symbol," she actually bucked some of the social trends of the mid-20th century that still strike a chord today  — and that is 60 years after she succumbed to a barbiturate overdose on August 5, 1962. Having premiered at the 2022 Venice Film Festival and been released in cinemas in the US on September 16 and in the UK on September 23, many critics have already celebrated the film, and especially the performance of the lead, Cuban-born Ana de Armas. Actress Ana de Armas was lauded for her portrayal of Monroe Professionally, her come-hither looks, breathy voice — a strategy suggested by a speech therapist to overcome a stutter — and the sexuality-driven roles she landed, reduced her to a two dimensional character that pandered primarily to male fantasies. The film depicts the actress's fraught relationships with the men in her life Originally held up as an example of why feminism was necessary to counter the sexual exploitation and objectification of women, she has since been recognized for her own demands for self-determination. Meanwhile, she was unabashed about her curves and embraced her sexuality in a way once seen as the antithesis of feminism. One of her most-mentioned acts of awareness was when she used her celebrity to enable jazz star Ella Fitzgerald to perform at a club that originally refused to hire her. This is an updated version of an article that was originally published on August 4, 2022.

# Burkina Faso: Is the recent coup a boon for Russia?

https://www.dw.com/en/burkina-faso-is-the-recent-coup-a-boon-for-russia/a-63332163
<blockquote>
A security expert in Ghana, Muktar pointed to increased extremist violence on the northern borders of Togo, Benin and Ivory Coast. West Africa's regional body, ECOWAS, also condemned Friday's coup in Burkina Faso "in the strongest possible terms," calling it "inappropriate." "In the last couple of years, we have seen the same dysfunctional approach to dealing with the issue of coups and insecurity in the region." Some residents accused France of working with Damiba to conduct a coup within a coup on Saturday. Praise for Captain Traore Adib said it was sad that terrorists were winning in Burkina Faso. "It's what has resulted or culminated in the coups we are witnessing, particularly in Mali and Burkina Faso," Adib added. He added that France and other Western partners seem to be becoming unpopular and that governments in the region are looking to ignite relationships with countries that they believe will bring a new dynamic. "We are supposed to be partners in this, but when there are cracks, when there are divisions, it plays to the advantage of the terrorists," Adib said.

# European farmers struggle to contain deadly bird flu

https://www.dw.com/en/european-farmers-struggle-to-contain-deadly-bird-flu/a-63302531
<blockquote>
Poultry farmer Alrik Visscher from Dalfsen in the eastern part of the Netherlands is one of the farmers who has lost all his birds because of the flu. There have been regular outbreaks of this sickness, which is deadly for many birds, for more than year, though normally, the bird flu season in Europe lasts from October until April or May. In the Netherlands alone, more than 4 million chickens and ducks had to be culled, while hundreds of thousands wild birds have died. Barely any European country escaped cases of bird flu among wild birds or poultry since the beginning of this season in October 2021. Just like in the Netherlands, where the density of poultry farms is among the highest in Europe. According to the EFSA, high poultry density is one of the factors leading to a faster spread of the virus, which usually comes from Asia via migratory wild birds spending the winter in Europe. A positive test at one farm leads to the installation of a 3-kilometer-wide-protection zone in which all farms have to prove they have no bird flu – and at affected farms all birds are culled as the virus is highly infectious. In rare cases, mammals also caught the bird flu, but the risk for humans is very low, according to the EFSA. The only hope among bird conservationists and farmers is now: A vast spread of the virus leading to a high immunity among the local birds. New hygiene measures are to be announced; only then can new birds arrive.

# Opinion: EU eyes up Germany's 'double whammy'

https://www.dw.com/en/opinion-eu-eyes-up-germanys-double-whammy/a-63333411
<blockquote>
At the EU finance ministers' meeting in Luxembourg, more and more member states, as well as two EU commissioners, called for "European solidarity," i.e., more debt at the EU level. Instead of putting the money toward this "Made in Germany" rescue package — it is still unclear how it will actually work — Germany could have used it to help the EU they say. Should it? The energy crisis cannot be compared with the COVID-19 crisis. And, unlike in the COVID-19 crisis, neither the state nor Europe will be able to protect people from the drastic consequences of the recession Putin has triggered. Minister for Economic Affairs Habeck, Chancellor Scholz and Finance Minister Lindner announce the 'double whammy' The EU has questions to answer Simply calling on Germany to act as paymaster is no help at all.

# What does the Nord Stream pipeline gas leak mean for the environment?

https://www.dw.com/en/what-does-the-nord-stream-pipeline-gas-leak-mean-for-the-environment/a-63268348
<blockquote>
The gas from the Nord Stream pipeline leaks would have been burned for energy use regardless of the leak, so it is unlikely that more emissions were released than normal. Research has found that methane emissions are 80 times worse than carbon dioxide emissions over a 20 year scale — and that they already account for roughly 30% of global warming. Human activity over the past 150 years has prompted a huge rise in artificial greenhouse gas emissions, causing global temperatures to soar at an alarming rate. Data show that the impact of a man-made climate crisis from greenhouse gas emissions is already being felt around the world — including in Germany. At the UN global climate conference COP26 late last year, more than 100 nations pledged to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030. Nord Stream 1 and 2 are now shut down indefinitely because of the leaks — but many countries in Europe, including Germany, rely on these gas pipelines for energy.

# Methane gas: What's the big deal?

https://www.dw.com/en/methane-gas-whats-the-big-deal/a-59059353
<blockquote>
While the gas, also known as CH4, has become almost synonymous with cattle flatulence, there's actually much more to it than that. Scientists estimate that although methane only accounts for 3% of emissions since 1750, it is linked to as much as 23% of historic warming. In other words, the stuff is potent. Partly, but not only, as a result of gassy livestock, the agricultural sector causes the same amount of warming as 788 million cars, which is more than half of the world's 1.4 billion-strong fleet. And what's more, the natural gas saved from patching up the leaks would more than pay for the upgrades. And at least we can use methane to burn. Not when we could be talking permafrost. Thing is, as the Arctic heats up, areas of Earth that have been locked in frozen slumber for many millennia, are starting to thaw. Some of this former icescape then transforms into new wetlands, which release methane into the atmosphere, helping temperatures to rise. Thawing permafrost could increase non-human methane emissions by 80%. But even as individuals we can make a contribution by (whether we like it or not), cutting back on burgers, palm oil and flying. But that, we have seen by now, is the one thing the planet cannot afford to let happen.

# Depeche Mode to release new album and go on world tour

The band's remaining permanent members, guitarist and keyboardist Martin Gore and lead singer Dave Gahan, announced in Berlin on October 4 that they will release a new album "towards the end of March" and embark on a world tour. Yet, in their early years, the band was dismissed as synth-pop pinups: a boy band that was unlikely to last. Depeche Mode then went on to sell more than 100 million albums, winning over a global audience with hit singles such as "Personal Jesus," "People Are People" or "Enjoy The Silence." Depeche Mode Speaking to an NME journalist in West Germany in 1984, Andy Fletcher said: "The last time we refused an interview with them, they made up a story about Dave having to be carried off stage at the end of every performance, taken to a separate dressing room and kept supplied with constant fluids. "It sometimes feels a bit strange to be able to do this," Gahan said, "but to be able to walk on a stage and bring some joy to a lot of people is something that we are pretty proud of.” "For sure he'll be there in spirit — or, you know, judging us," Gahan laughed.

# 'The Satanic Verses': The long road to German publication

https://www.dw.com/en/the-satanic-verses-the-long-road-to-german-publication/a-63276797
<blockquote>
When Salman Rushdie's fourth novel, "The Satanic Verses," appeared in its English-language first edition on September 26, 1988, the writer could not yet have imagined that this book would fundamentally change his life. "The Satanic Verses" in German "The fatwa led to paralysis in the publishing house," Helge Malchow, editor at the time and later publishing director, told DW. "I thought it was a crime not to publish the book," he said. German writer Hans Magnus Enzensberger turned to Widmann's friend Frank Berberich, publisher of the culture magazine Lettre International. "I thought it was a crime not to publish the book," Arno Widmann said After the Turkish writer Aziz Nesin announced that he would publish excerpts from Rushdie's book, Islamists carried out an arson attack on a culture festival in 1993 because Nesin was scheduled to be there. Back in 1989, about 100 publishing houses, writers' associations, editors and authors got together to found a new publishing house that would publish "The Satanic Verses" in German. The Article 19 publishing house, whose name refers to the freedom of expression in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, served the sole purpose of publishing Rushdie's novel. Bernhard Robben, who later translated several of Rushdie's works into German, told DW that, as much as he would have liked to translate the book, he struggled with the idea of living "in fear of death." Robben was living in Oxford at the time and he and Rushdie met and got along well. It was unthinkable to him that this book would not be published in German and that the attack on freedom of expression would succeed. Bernhard Robben, who co-translated "Joseph Anton," is in fact "pretty sure it wouldn't be published today."

# England's WSL: Is it living up to the hype?

https://www.dw.com/en/englands-wsl-is-it-living-up-to-the-hype/a-63286432
<blockquote>
But now these are the people that are interested in watching, those people are fans of the game and they will come to watch us again and again and again, I hope," she told DW, before striking a slightly more cautious note. I question it because it has to be fixture-friendly with the men's team and there's a lot of things [to fall in to place for] a day like today." But a somewhat unforeseen effect of affordable tickets and increased demand has been empty seats at sold out games. Though several WSL clubs have sold out their season tickets for games that are, for the most part, at much smaller stadiums, there is a suggestion that some fans buy them to secure a few key games in a season and won't necessarily attend every match. "I think we've now entered that phase of women's football becoming a business," said the head coach of WSL champions Chelsea, Emma Hayes, after the Euros win. "The next step is the league leaving the FA and going to the Premier League or an independent body and that there is a vision around the women's game so we don't just have single big moments – single events once every two years or once a year – that they're every week." For now though, with the exception of a handful of clubs in Spain, France and Germany, it's clear the combination of money, better facilities and bigger crowds have made the WSL the destination of choice for the world's best players. "We can now start pushing in that competition as a league, WSL, in the Champions League," said Williamson to DW before Arsenal snuck past Ajax and in to the group stage. "And from our perspective that's where we should be."

Borussia Dortmund said they would travel to more than half of their away games (nine-plus games) this season by bus, while Schalke said that, so far this campaign, the club had traveled to three away games by bus and one by plane. Werder Bremen stated that last season (when Werder were in the second division) they made 10 away trips by bus, five by plane (three on scheduled flights) and two by train. Freiburg stated that games in the area around them in the south and southwest of Germany were usually traveled to on the bus, that before the pandemic, games in the west were visited by train and that longer trips, such as Berlin or Bremen, were done by plane. "There has been no deliberate attempt to curb air travel," Mattioli said. If you constrain supply then demand will have to find a way to adapt."

A trial between the two parties was scheduled to start on October 17, with Twitter seeking to compel Musk to go through with the deal and Musk accusing the company of fraud in a countersuit. Observers had commented in recent weeks that Musk appeared to be facing an uphill battle convincing the Delaware court that core information about Twitter had changed sufficiently since April to justify calling off the transaction. "On the legal merits, his case didn't look that strong," Talley told AP. The news also coincides with the outspoken billionaire attracting negative attention for comments about Russia's invasion of Ukraine, posted on Twitter.

https://www.dw.com/en/burkina-faso-is-the-recent-coup-a-boon-for-russia/a-63332163
<blockquote>
A security expert in Ghana, Muktar pointed to increased extremist violence on the northern borders of Togo, Benin and Ivory Coast. West Africa's regional body, ECOWAS, also condemned Friday's coup in Burkina Faso "in the strongest possible terms," calling it "inappropriate." "In the last couple of years, we have seen the same dysfunctional approach to dealing with the issue of coups and insecurity in the region." Some residents accused France of working with Damiba to conduct a coup within a coup on Saturday. Praise for Captain Traore Adib said it was sad that terrorists were winning in Burkina Faso. "It's what has resulted or culminated in the coups we are witnessing, particularly in Mali and Burkina Faso," Adib added. He added that France and other Western partners seem to be becoming unpopular and that governments in the region are looking to ignite relationships with countries that they believe will bring a new dynamic. "We are supposed to be partners in this, but when there are cracks, when there are divisions, it plays to the advantage of the terrorists," Adib said.

# Opinion: EU eyes up Germany's 'double whammy'

https://www.dw.com/en/opinion-eu-eyes-up-germanys-double-whammy/a-63333411
<blockquote>
At the EU finance ministers' meeting in Luxembourg, more and more member states, as well as two EU commissioners, called for "European solidarity," i.e., more debt at the EU level. Instead of putting the money toward this "Made in Germany" rescue package — it is still unclear how it will actually work — Germany could have used it to help the EU they say. Should it? The energy crisis cannot be compared with the COVID-19 crisis. And, unlike in the COVID-19 crisis, neither the state nor Europe will be able to protect people from the drastic consequences of the recession Putin has triggered. Minister for Economic Affairs Habeck, Chancellor Scholz and Finance Minister Lindner announce the 'double whammy' The EU has questions to answer Simply calling on Germany to act as paymaster is no help at all.

# New film shows why Marilyn Monroe was so much more than a sex symbol

https://www.dw.com/en/new-film-shows-why-marilyn-monroe-was-so-much-more-than-a-sex-symbol/a-57721834
<blockquote>
More often labeled "blonde bombshell" or "sex symbol," she actually bucked some of the social trends of the mid-20th century that still strike a chord today  — and that is 60 years after she succumbed to a barbiturate overdose on August 5, 1962. Having premiered at the 2022 Venice Film Festival and been released in cinemas in the US on September 16 and in the UK on September 23, many critics have already celebrated the film, and especially the performance of the lead, Cuban-born Ana de Armas. Actress Ana de Armas was lauded for her portrayal of Monroe Professionally, her come-hither looks, breathy voice — a strategy suggested by a speech therapist to overcome a stutter — and the sexuality-driven roles she landed, reduced her to a two dimensional character that pandered primarily to male fantasies. The film depicts the actress's fraught relationships with the men in her life Originally held up as an example of why feminism was necessary to counter the sexual exploitation and objectification of women, she has since been recognized for her own demands for self-determination. Meanwhile, she was unabashed about her curves and embraced her sexuality in a way once seen as the antithesis of feminism. One of her most-mentioned acts of awareness was when she used her celebrity to enable jazz star Ella Fitzgerald to perform at a club that originally refused to hire her. This is an updated version of an article that was originally published on August 4, 2022.

# EU approves German state funding of BASF renewable hydrogen bid

https://www.dw.com/en/eu-approves-german-state-funding-of-basf-renewable-hydrogen-bid/a-63322963
<blockquote>
"The measure approved today will also help Germany replace fossil-based hydrogen in a hard-to-decarbonize industry, and reduce its dependence on imported fossil fuels, in line with the REPowerEU Plan," Vestager said, referring to the EU's new energy program launched in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine seeking to save energy, diversify and reduce dependence of Russian fossil fuels and accelerate some areas of green research. What will the hydrogen be used for? Any excess hydrogen the facility in Ludwigshafen might generate would be used for projects such as hydrogen-powered buses and trains in Germany, the EU said. According to analysts at Deloitte, the chemicals industry in the EU uses 10 million tons of hydrogen a year. It also said any impact on competition and trade would be limited, that the proposed figure matched the costs of the project, and noted that in the event of the endeavor being unexpectedly lucrative, mechanisms were in place whereby BASF would partially reimburse the German taxpayer.

# 'The Satanic Verses': The long road to German publication

https://www.dw.com/en/the-satanic-verses-the-long-road-to-german-publication/a-63276797
<blockquote>
When Salman Rushdie's fourth novel, "The Satanic Verses," appeared in its English-language first edition on September 26, 1988, the writer could not yet have imagined that this book would fundamentally change his life. "The Satanic Verses" in German "The fatwa led to paralysis in the publishing house," Helge Malchow, editor at the time and later publishing director, told DW. "I thought it was a crime not to publish the book," he said. German writer Hans Magnus Enzensberger turned to Widmann's friend Frank Berberich, publisher of the culture magazine Lettre International. "I thought it was a crime not to publish the book," Arno Widmann said After the Turkish writer Aziz Nesin announced that he would publish excerpts from Rushdie's book, Islamists carried out an arson attack on a culture festival in 1993 because Nesin was scheduled to be there. Back in 1989, about 100 publishing houses, writers' associations, editors and authors got together to found a new publishing house that would publish "The Satanic Verses" in German. The Article 19 publishing house, whose name refers to the freedom of expression in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, served the sole purpose of publishing Rushdie's novel. Bernhard Robben, who later translated several of Rushdie's works into German, told DW that, as much as he would have liked to translate the book, he struggled with the idea of living "in fear of death." Robben was living in Oxford at the time and he and Rushdie met and got along well. It was unthinkable to him that this book would not be published in German and that the attack on freedom of expression would succeed. Bernhard Robben, who co-translated "Joseph Anton," is in fact "pretty sure it wouldn't be published today."

# Methane gas: What's the big deal?

https://www.dw.com/en/methane-gas-whats-the-big-deal/a-59059353
<blockquote>
While the gas, also known as CH4, has become almost synonymous with cattle flatulence, there's actually much more to it than that. Scientists estimate that although methane only accounts for 3% of emissions since 1750, it is linked to as much as 23% of historic warming. In other words, the stuff is potent. Partly, but not only, as a result of gassy livestock, the agricultural sector causes the same amount of warming as 788 million cars, which is more than half of the world's 1.4 billion-strong fleet. And what's more, the natural gas saved from patching up the leaks would more than pay for the upgrades. And at least we can use methane to burn. Not when we could be talking permafrost. Thing is, as the Arctic heats up, areas of Earth that have been locked in frozen slumber for many millennia, are starting to thaw. Some of this former icescape then transforms into new wetlands, which release methane into the atmosphere, helping temperatures to rise. Thawing permafrost could increase non-human methane emissions by 80%. But even as individuals we can make a contribution by (whether we like it or not), cutting back on burgers, palm oil and flying. But that, we have seen by now, is the one thing the planet cannot afford to let happen.

# Taiwan: Does Germany parliamentary visit risk antagonizing China?

https://www.dw.com/en/taiwan-does-germany-parliamentary-visit-risk-antagonizing-china/a-63329462
<blockquote>
"We do not consider it acceptable that you are threatened by a neighbor with military force, to be forced into unwanted cooperation," he said. However, analyst Barkin said there is a risk that Germany is unprepared for the fallout of a conflict in the Taiwan Strait. "But there is a risk that Germany is just as unprepared for a conflict in the Taiwan Strait as it was for Vladimir Putin's invasion. There is a lot more work to do at the national and European levels to prepare for Taiwan scenarios," he added. "The fact that the German delegation coming to Taiwan is a cross-partisan delegation sends a message that it is normal to engage with Taiwan and it is normal to foster people-to-people relations because this is inherently what parliamentary delegations do," he added. "While the lawmakers don't represent the German government's official position, the cross-partisan nature of the delegation shows there is cross-party support for Taiwan in the German parliament." During the remainder of the trip, the German delegation is expected to visit Taiwan's parliament, hold meetings with local security think tanks and visit Tainan Science Park in the southern part of the island. Chih-Mei Luo, a European studies expert at National Taipei University in Taiwan, hopes there will be more emphasis on trade and economic affairs, as collaboration in these areas generally creates fewer risks for Taiwan.

# Depeche Mode to release new album and go on world tour

<blockquote>
The band's remaining permanent members, guitarist and keyboardist Martin Gore and lead singer Dave Gahan, announced in Berlin on October 4 that they will release a new album "towards the end of March" and embark on a world tour. Yet, in their early years, the band was dismissed as synth-pop pinups: a boy band that was unlikely to last. Depeche Mode then went on to sell more than 100 million albums, winning over a global audience with hit singles such as "Personal Jesus," "People Are People" or "Enjoy The Silence." Depeche Mode Speaking to an NME journalist in West Germany in 1984, Andy Fletcher said: "The last time we refused an interview with them, they made up a story about Dave having to be carried off stage at the end of every performance, taken to a separate dressing room and kept supplied with constant fluids. "It sometimes feels a bit strange to be able to do this," Gahan said, "but to be able to walk on a stage and bring some joy to a lot of people is something that we are pretty proud of.” "For sure he'll be there in spirit — or, you know, judging us," Gahan laughed.

https://www.dw.com/en/burkina-faso-is-the-recent-coup-a-boon-for-russia/a-63332163
<blockquote>
A security expert in Ghana, Muktar pointed to increased extremist violence on the northern borders of Togo, Benin and Ivory Coast. West Africa's regional body, ECOWAS, also condemned Friday's coup in Burkina Faso "in the strongest possible terms," calling it "inappropriate." "In the last couple of years, we have seen the same dysfunctional approach to dealing with the issue of coups and insecurity in the region." Some residents accused France of working with Damiba to conduct a coup within a coup on Saturday. Praise for Captain Traore Adib said it was sad that terrorists were winning in Burkina Faso. "It's what has resulted or culminated in the coups we are witnessing, particularly in Mali and Burkina Faso," Adib added. He added that France and other Western partners seem to be becoming unpopular and that governments in the region are looking to ignite relationships with countries that they believe will bring a new dynamic. "We are supposed to be partners in this, but when there are cracks, when there are divisions, it plays to the advantage of the terrorists," Adib said.

# Champions League: Makoto Hasebe proves Frankfurt's hero

https://www.dw.com/en/champions-league-makoto-hasebe-proves-frankfurts-hero/a-63332874
<blockquote>
"Today, against Harry Kane, he's probably physically not as strong but he had him under control," Trapp continued. Despite having 11 attempts on goal, Tottenham finished the night with no shots on target and with Kevin Trapp not really having to make a save. Hasebe, aided by N'Dicka and Tuta, was the central piece of a strong back three and the Japanese veteran, as one of the most vertical passers of the ball, often looked to convert his calmness on the ball into an attacking move for Frankfurt. Frankfurt did not finish the night with three points, as they did in Marseille last time out, but this was a point they full deserved.

# Germany's Scholz defends energy support plan as 'justified'

https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-scholz-defends-energy-support-plan-as-justified/a-63331185
<blockquote>
The German chancellor on Tuesday said a €200 billion ($198 billion) energy support package was justified and that similar steps were being taken elsewhere. ... Our package ... is proportionate if you compare the size and the vulnerability of the German economy," Lindner said. Opponents of the package say it will distort competition inside the single market by giving an advantage to German businesses. "We are fully committed to preserving a level playing field and a single market, and avoiding harmful subsidy races," a spokesperson for the commission told a news conference.

# EU approves German state funding of BASF renewable hydrogen bid

https://www.dw.com/en/eu-approves-german-state-funding-of-basf-renewable-hydrogen-bid/a-63322963
<blockquote>
"The measure approved today will also help Germany replace fossil-based hydrogen in a hard-to-decarbonize industry, and reduce its dependence on imported fossil fuels, in line with the REPowerEU Plan," Vestager said, referring to the EU's new energy program launched in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine seeking to save energy, diversify and reduce dependence of Russian fossil fuels and accelerate some areas of green research. What will the hydrogen be used for? Any excess hydrogen the facility in Ludwigshafen might generate would be used for projects such as hydrogen-powered buses and trains in Germany, the EU said. According to analysts at Deloitte, the chemicals industry in the EU uses 10 million tons of hydrogen a year. It also said any impact on competition and trade would be limited, that the proposed figure matched the costs of the project, and noted that in the event of the endeavor being unexpectedly lucrative, mechanisms were in place whereby BASF would partially reimburse the German taxpayer.

<blockquote>
Fans of Karimi's former club, Bayern Munich, offered support to the protests in Iran when during Friday's Bundesliga match against Bayer Leverkusen, fans unfurled a banner that read: "Women, Life, Freedom! Solidarity with the feminist revolution in Iran!" Iranian athletes from other sports are also standing up to those in power. Sadjad Estaki, who in 2015 became the first Iranian to play in Germany's renowned national handball league, announced his resignation from the Iranian national team in protest of the heavy-handed response to Iranian demonstrations. For the national team, which is the center of the sporting world for the football-loving people of Iran, support is crumbling shortly before the World Cup in Qatar. "Why should FIFA give the Iranian state and its representatives a global stage?" "This state not only refuses to respect fundamental rights and human dignity. Many people around the world have been showing solidarity with the protesters in Iran.

# Opinion: EU eyes up Germany's 'double whammy'

https://www.dw.com/en/opinion-eu-eyes-up-germanys-double-whammy/a-63333411
<blockquote>
At the EU finance ministers' meeting in Luxembourg, more and more member states, as well as two EU commissioners, called for "European solidarity," i.e., more debt at the EU level. Instead of putting the money toward this "Made in Germany" rescue package — it is still unclear how it will actually work — Germany could have used it to help the EU they say. Should it? The energy crisis cannot be compared with the COVID-19 crisis. And, unlike in the COVID-19 crisis, neither the state nor Europe will be able to protect people from the drastic consequences of the recession Putin has triggered. Minister for Economic Affairs Habeck, Chancellor Scholz and Finance Minister Lindner announce the 'double whammy' The EU has questions to answer Simply calling on Germany to act as paymaster is no help at all.
