# European farmers struggle to contain deadly bird flu

https://www.dw.com/en/european-farmers-struggle-to-contain-deadly-bird-flu/a-63302531
<blockquote>
Poultry farmer Alrik Visscher from Dalfsen in the eastern part of the Netherlands is one of the farmers who has lost all his birds because of the flu. There have been regular outbreaks of this sickness, which is deadly for many birds, for more than year, though normally, the bird flu season in Europe lasts from October until April or May. In the Netherlands alone, more than 4 million chickens and ducks had to be culled, while hundreds of thousands wild birds have died. Barely any European country escaped cases of bird flu among wild birds or poultry since the beginning of this season in October 2021. Just like in the Netherlands, where the density of poultry farms is among the highest in Europe. According to the EFSA, high poultry density is one of the factors leading to a faster spread of the virus, which usually comes from Asia via migratory wild birds spending the winter in Europe. A positive test at one farm leads to the installation of a 3-kilometer-wide-protection zone in which all farms have to prove they have no bird flu – and at affected farms all birds are culled as the virus is highly infectious. Measures like quarantines and early cullings of animals on the farms can lower the threat of a spread – but they cannot contain it completely. The only hope among bird conservationists and farmers is now: A vast spread of the virus leading to a high immunity among the local birds. New hygiene measures are to be announced; only then can new birds arrive.

# 'The Satanic Verses': The long road to German publication

https://www.dw.com/en/the-satanic-verses-the-long-road-to-german-publication/a-63276797
<blockquote>
When Salman Rushdie's fourth novel, "The Satanic Verses," appeared in its English-language first edition on September 26, 1988, the writer could not yet have imagined that this book would fundamentally change his life. "The Satanic Verses" in German "The fatwa led to paralysis in the publishing house," Helge Malchow, editor at the time and later publishing director, told DW. "I thought it was a crime not to publish the book," he said. German writer Hans Magnus Enzensberger turned to Widmann's friend Frank Berberich, publisher of the culture magazine Lettre International. "I thought it was a crime not to publish the book," Arno Widmann said After the Turkish writer Aziz Nesin announced that he would publish excerpts from Rushdie's book, Islamists carried out an arson attack on a culture festival in 1993 because Nesin was scheduled to be there. Back in 1989, about 100 publishing houses, writers' associations, editors and authors got together to found a new publishing house that would publish "The Satanic Verses" in German. The Article 19 publishing house, whose name refers to the freedom of expression in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, served the sole purpose of publishing Rushdie's novel. Bernhard Robben, who later translated several of Rushdie's works into German, told DW that, as much as he would have liked to translate the book, he struggled with the idea of living "in fear of death." Robben was living in Oxford at the time and he and Rushdie met and got along well. It was unthinkable to him that this book would not be published in German and that the attack on freedom of expression would succeed. Bernhard Robben, who co-translated "Joseph Anton," is in fact "pretty sure it wouldn't be published today."

# England's WSL: Is it living up to the hype?

https://www.dw.com/en/englands-wsl-is-it-living-up-to-the-hype/a-63286432
<blockquote>
But now these are the people that are interested in watching, those people are fans of the game and they will come to watch us again and again and again, I hope," she told DW, before striking a slightly more cautious note. I question it because it has to be fixture-friendly with the men's team and there's a lot of things [to fall in to place for] a day like today." But a somewhat unforeseen effect of affordable tickets and increased demand has been empty seats at sold out games. Though several WSL clubs have sold out their season tickets for games that are, for the most part, at much smaller stadiums, there is a suggestion that some fans buy them to secure a few key games in a season and won't necessarily attend every match. "I think we've now entered that phase of women's football becoming a business," said the head coach of WSL champions Chelsea, Emma Hayes, after the Euros win. "The next step is the league leaving the FA and going to the Premier League or an independent body and that there is a vision around the women's game so we don't just have single big moments – single events once every two years or once a year – that they're every week." For now though, with the exception of a handful of clubs in Spain, France and Germany, it's clear the combination of money, better facilities and bigger crowds have made the WSL the destination of choice for the world's best players. "We can now start pushing in that competition as a league, WSL, in the Champions League," said Williamson to DW before Arsenal snuck past Ajax and in to the group stage. "And from our perspective that's where we should be."

# How do Bundesliga clubs travel to away games?

https://www.dw.com/en/how-do-bundesliga-clubs-travel-to-away-games/a-63215695
<blockquote>
Much has been made of the emissions generated by fans' traveling, so what about the clubs themselves? Plane, bus or train? DW inquired at each of the 18 Bundesliga clubs about their method of travel for away games. Borussia Dortmund said they would travel to more than half of their away games (nine-plus games) this season by bus, while Schalke said that, so far this campaign, the club had traveled to three away games by bus and one by plane. Werder Bremen stated that last season (when Werder were in the second division) they made 10 away trips by bus, five by plane (three on scheduled flights) and two by train. Freiburg stated that games in the area around them in the south and southwest of Germany were usually traveled to on the bus, that before the pandemic, games in the west were visited by train and that longer trips, such as Berlin or Bremen, were done by plane. "There has been no deliberate attempt to curb air travel," Mattioli said. If you constrain supply then demand will have to find a way to adapt."

# Thailand: Will Prayuth Chan-ocha ruling unleash a new political crisis?

https://www.dw.com/en/thailand-will-prayuth-chan-ocha-ruling-unleash-a-new-political-crisis/a-63296828
<blockquote>
Thailand's current constitution stipulates a term limit of eight years for a prime minister. Opposition parties said the ex-army chief has overstayed his tenure, which they contend started when he seized power in a military coup in 2014. Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha took power in a military coup Despite the constitutional change, it is very clear that everything is designed for Prayuth to be in power. In Myanmar, people show the three-finger salute as a sign of protest against the military coup. Punchada Sirivunnabood, political scientist at Thailand's Mahidol University, told DW that Prayuth remains the preferred leader among Thailand's pro-junta political establishment and this could have influenced the decision to extend his premiership.

# Elon Musk deal to buy Twitter for $44 billion is back on

https://www.dw.com/en/elon-musk-deal-to-buy-twitter-for-44-billion-is-back-on/a-63332657
<blockquote>
Musk made the offer in a letter to Twitter, which was also filed with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) before the close of trade on Tuesday. A spokesperson for Twitter said that the company had received Musk's letter and filed it with the SEC. A trial between the two parties was scheduled to start on October 17, with Twitter seeking to compel Musk to go through with the deal and Musk accusing the company of fraud in a countersuit. Observers had commented in recent weeks that Musk appeared to be facing an uphill battle convincing the Delaware court that core information about Twitter had changed sufficiently since April to justify calling off the transaction. "On the legal merits, his case didn't look that strong," Talley told AP. The news also coincides with the outspoken billionaire attracting negative attention for comments about Russia's invasion of Ukraine, posted on Twitter.

# Champions League: Makoto Hasebe proves Frankfurt's hero

https://www.dw.com/en/champions-league-makoto-hasebe-proves-frankfurts-hero/a-63332874
<blockquote>
"Today, against Harry Kane, he's probably physically not as strong but he had him under control," Trapp continued. Despite having 11 attempts on goal, Tottenham finished the night with no shots on target and with Kevin Trapp not really having to make a save. Hasebe, aided by N'Dicka and Tuta, was the central piece of a strong back three and the Japanese veteran, as one of the most vertical passers of the ball, often looked to convert his calmness on the ball into an attacking move for Frankfurt. Frankfurt did not finish the night with three points, as they did in Marseille last time out, but this was a point they full deserved.

# New film shows why Marilyn Monroe was so much more than a sex symbol

https://www.dw.com/en/new-film-shows-why-marilyn-monroe-was-so-much-more-than-a-sex-symbol/a-57721834
<blockquote>
More often labeled "blonde bombshell" or "sex symbol," she actually bucked some of the social trends of the mid-20th century that still strike a chord today  — and that is 60 years after she succumbed to a barbiturate overdose on August 5, 1962. Having premiered at the 2022 Venice Film Festival and been released in cinemas in the US on September 16 and in the UK on September 23, many critics have already celebrated the film, and especially the performance of the lead, Cuban-born Ana de Armas. Actress Ana de Armas was lauded for her portrayal of Monroe Professionally, her come-hither looks, breathy voice — a strategy suggested by a speech therapist to overcome a stutter — and the sexuality-driven roles she landed, reduced her to a two dimensional character that pandered primarily to male fantasies. The film depicts the actress's fraught relationships with the men in her life Originally held up as an example of why feminism was necessary to counter the sexual exploitation and objectification of women, she has since been recognized for her own demands for self-determination. Meanwhile, she was unabashed about her curves and embraced her sexuality in a way once seen as the antithesis of feminism. One of her most-mentioned acts of awareness was when she used her celebrity to enable jazz star Ella Fitzgerald to perform at a club that originally refused to hire her.

# Methane gas: What's the big deal?

https://www.dw.com/en/methane-gas-whats-the-big-deal/a-59059353
<blockquote>
While the gas, also known as CH4, has become almost synonymous with cattle flatulence, there's actually much more to it than that. Scientists estimate that although methane only accounts for 3% of emissions since 1750, it is linked to as much as 23% of historic warming. In other words, the stuff is potent. Partly, but not only, as a result of gassy livestock, the agricultural sector causes the same amount of warming as 788 million cars, which is more than half of the world's 1.4 billion-strong fleet. And what's more, the natural gas saved from patching up the leaks would more than pay for the upgrades. And at least we can use methane to burn. Not when we could be talking permafrost. Thing is, as the Arctic heats up, areas of Earth that have been locked in frozen slumber for many millennia, are starting to thaw. Some of this former icescape then transforms into new wetlands, which release methane into the atmosphere, helping temperatures to rise. Thawing permafrost could increase non-human methane emissions by 80%. But even as individuals we can make a contribution by (whether we like it or not), cutting back on burgers, palm oil and flying. But that, we have seen by now, is the one thing the planet cannot afford to let happen.

# Burkina Faso: Is the recent coup a boon for Russia?

A security expert in Ghana, Muktar pointed to increased extremist violence on the northern borders of Togo, Benin and Ivory Coast. West Africa's regional body, ECOWAS, also condemned Friday's coup in Burkina Faso "in the strongest possible terms," calling it "inappropriate." "In the last couple of years, we have seen the same dysfunctional approach to dealing with the issue of coups and insecurity in the region." Some residents accused France of working with Damiba to conduct a coup within a coup on Saturday. Praise for Captain Traore Adib said it was sad that terrorists were winning in Burkina Faso. "It's what has resulted or culminated in the coups we are witnessing, particularly in Mali and Burkina Faso," Adib added. He added that France and other Western partners seem to be becoming unpopular and that governments in the region are looking to ignite relationships with countries that they believe will bring a new dynamic. "We are supposed to be partners in this, but when there are cracks, when there are divisions, it plays to the advantage of the terrorists," Adib said.

# EU approves German state funding of BASF renewable hydrogen bid

https://www.dw.com/en/eu-approves-german-state-funding-of-basf-renewable-hydrogen-bid/a-63322963
<blockquote>
"The measure approved today will also help Germany replace fossil-based hydrogen in a hard-to-decarbonize industry, and reduce its dependence on imported fossil fuels, in line with the REPowerEU Plan," Vestager said, referring to the EU's new energy program launched in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine seeking to save energy, diversify and reduce dependence of Russian fossil fuels and accelerate some areas of green research. What will the hydrogen be used for? Any excess hydrogen the facility in Ludwigshafen might generate would be used for projects such as hydrogen-powered buses and trains in Germany, the EU said. According to analysts at Deloitte, the chemicals industry in the EU uses 10 million tons of hydrogen a year. It also said any impact on competition and trade would be limited, that the proposed figure matched the costs of the project, and noted that in the event of the endeavor being unexpectedly lucrative, mechanisms were in place whereby BASF would partially reimburse the German taxpayer.

# Taiwan: Does Germany parliamentary visit risk antagonizing China?

"We do not consider it acceptable that you are threatened by a neighbor with military force, to be forced into unwanted cooperation," he said. However, analyst Barkin said there is a risk that Germany is unprepared for the fallout of a conflict in the Taiwan Strait. "But there is a risk that Germany is just as unprepared for a conflict in the Taiwan Strait as it was for Vladimir Putin's invasion. There is a lot more work to do at the national and European levels to prepare for Taiwan scenarios," he added. "The fact that the German delegation coming to Taiwan is a cross-partisan delegation sends a message that it is normal to engage with Taiwan and it is normal to foster people-to-people relations because this is inherently what parliamentary delegations do," he added. "While the lawmakers don't represent the German government's official position, the cross-partisan nature of the delegation shows there is cross-party support for Taiwan in the German parliament." During the remainder of the trip, the German delegation is expected to visit Taiwan's parliament, hold meetings with local security think tanks and visit Tainan Science Park in the southern part of the island. Chih-Mei Luo, a European studies expert at National Taipei University in Taiwan, hopes there will be more emphasis on trade and economic affairs, as collaboration in these areas generally creates fewer risks for Taiwan.

https://www.dw.com/en/opinion-eu-eyes-up-germanys-double-whammy/a-63333411
<blockquote>
At the EU finance ministers' meeting in Luxembourg, more and more member states, as well as two EU commissioners, called for "European solidarity," i.e., more debt at the EU level. Instead of putting the money toward this "Made in Germany" rescue package — it is still unclear how it will actually work — Germany could have used it to help the EU they say. Should it? The energy crisis cannot be compared with the COVID-19 crisis. And, unlike in the COVID-19 crisis, neither the state nor Europe will be able to protect people from the drastic consequences of the recession Putin has triggered. Minister for Economic Affairs Habeck, Chancellor Scholz and Finance Minister Lindner announce the 'double whammy' The EU has questions to answer Simply calling on Germany to act as paymaster is no help at all.

# Nobel Prize: Svante Paabo wins the 2022 award for medicine for discoveries involving human evolution

https://www.dw.com/en/nobel-prize-svante-paabo-wins-the-2022-award-for-medicine-for-discoveries-involving-human-evolution/a-63283986
<blockquote>
It has become uncommon for the Nobel Committee to award prizes to individuals alone, but the 2022 Prize for Physiology or Medicine has indeed gone to just one person. Their work has not only taught scientists more about the Neanderthals, but it is also credited with having helped modern medicine during the COVID pandemic. "From the genome of Neanderthals, we can learn what defines modern humans. The Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine has been awarded 112 times since the prize's first year in 1901. Alfred Nobel established the prize in his will before he died in 1896. The very first Nobel Prize for medicine was awarded to Emil von Behring in 1903 for his discovery of a diphtheria antitoxin.

<blockquote>
The deputy mayor of Paris said there would be no fanzones with large TV screens in the city during the World Cup in Qatar. Le Monde quoted Marseille's city council as saying the tournament had turned into "a human and environmental catastrophe which is incompatible with the values that we want to see transmitted through sport and football in particular." Rabadan also alluded to "the conditions in which these facilities have been built" in Qatar, a reference to the treatment of migrant workers in the country working either on stadiums or other infrastructure projects related to the competition.

# EU approves German state funding of BASF renewable hydrogen bid

https://www.dw.com/en/eu-approves-german-state-funding-of-basf-renewable-hydrogen-bid/a-63322963
<blockquote>
"The measure approved today will also help Germany replace fossil-based hydrogen in a hard-to-decarbonize industry, and reduce its dependence on imported fossil fuels, in line with the REPowerEU Plan," Vestager said, referring to the EU's new energy program launched in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine seeking to save energy, diversify and reduce dependence of Russian fossil fuels and accelerate some areas of green research. What will the hydrogen be used for? Any excess hydrogen the facility in Ludwigshafen might generate would be used for projects such as hydrogen-powered buses and trains in Germany, the EU said. According to analysts at Deloitte, the chemicals industry in the EU uses 10 million tons of hydrogen a year. It also said any impact on competition and trade would be limited, that the proposed figure matched the costs of the project, and noted that in the event of the endeavor being unexpectedly lucrative, mechanisms were in place whereby BASF would partially reimburse the German taxpayer.

# Colombia, ELN guerrillas agree to restart peace talks

https://www.dw.com/en/colombia-eln-guerrillas-agree-to-restart-peace-talks/a-63337030
<blockquote>
The Colombian government and leftist guerrilla group the National Liberation Army (ELN) have announced plans to restart peace talks suspended since 2019. Venezuela, Cuba and Norway are to serve as guarantors for the talks. The 2016 peace deal between the Colombian government of then-President Juan Manuel Santos and FARC rebels left ELN as the nation's largest guerrilla group, although FARC dissidents who rejected the agreement remain active. In a statement, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres strongly commended the Colombian government's decision to resume peace talks and said the "resolution is critical for expanding the scope of peace in the country."

# 'The Satanic Verses': The long road to German publication

https://www.dw.com/en/the-satanic-verses-the-long-road-to-german-publication/a-63276797
<blockquote>
When Salman Rushdie's fourth novel, "The Satanic Verses," appeared in its English-language first edition on September 26, 1988, the writer could not yet have imagined that this book would fundamentally change his life. "The Satanic Verses" in German "The fatwa led to paralysis in the publishing house," Helge Malchow, editor at the time and later publishing director, told DW. "I thought it was a crime not to publish the book," he said. German writer Hans Magnus Enzensberger turned to Widmann's friend Frank Berberich, publisher of the culture magazine Lettre International. "I thought it was a crime not to publish the book," Arno Widmann said After the Turkish writer Aziz Nesin announced that he would publish excerpts from Rushdie's book, Islamists carried out an arson attack on a culture festival in 1993 because Nesin was scheduled to be there. Back in 1989, about 100 publishing houses, writers' associations, editors and authors got together to found a new publishing house that would publish "The Satanic Verses" in German. The Article 19 publishing house, whose name refers to the freedom of expression in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, served the sole purpose of publishing Rushdie's novel. Bernhard Robben, who later translated several of Rushdie's works into German, told DW that, as much as he would have liked to translate the book, he struggled with the idea of living "in fear of death." Robben was living in Oxford at the time and he and Rushdie met and got along well. It was unthinkable to him that this book would not be published in German and that the attack on freedom of expression would succeed. Bernhard Robben, who co-translated "Joseph Anton," is in fact "pretty sure it wouldn't be published today."

# Burkina Faso: Is the recent coup a boon for Russia?

A security expert in Ghana, Muktar pointed to increased extremist violence on the northern borders of Togo, Benin and Ivory Coast. West Africa's regional body, ECOWAS, also condemned Friday's coup in Burkina Faso "in the strongest possible terms," calling it "inappropriate." "In the last couple of years, we have seen the same dysfunctional approach to dealing with the issue of coups and insecurity in the region." Some residents accused France of working with Damiba to conduct a coup within a coup on Saturday. Praise for Captain Traore Adib said it was sad that terrorists were winning in Burkina Faso. "It's what has resulted or culminated in the coups we are witnessing, particularly in Mali and Burkina Faso," Adib added. He added that France and other Western partners seem to be becoming unpopular and that governments in the region are looking to ignite relationships with countries that they believe will bring a new dynamic. "We are supposed to be partners in this, but when there are cracks, when there are divisions, it plays to the advantage of the terrorists," Adib said.

<blockquote>
"Today, against Harry Kane, he's probably physically not as strong but he had him under control," Trapp continued. Despite having 11 attempts on goal, Tottenham finished the night with no shots on target and with Kevin Trapp not really having to make a save. Hasebe, aided by N'Dicka and Tuta, was the central piece of a strong back three and the Japanese veteran, as one of the most vertical passers of the ball, often looked to convert his calmness on the ball into an attacking move for Frankfurt. Frankfurt did not finish the night with three points, as they did in Marseille last time out, but this was a point they full deserved.

# Death and disease as Israeli troops approach Gaza’s al-Shifa Hospital

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/13/israeli-troops-at-gazas-main-hospital-gates-thousands-of-civilians-flee
<blockquote>
Medics have warned of mounting casualties among patients, including newborn babies, and concern of spreading disease is growing, as Israeli forces approach the gates of al-Shifa, Gaza City’s main hospital. Besieged for days by Israel’s military, doctors inside the hospital reiterated on Monday that the lack of fuel for electricity generators is leaving them unable to save patients. The Israeli military, whose ground forces entered the Strip in late October and quickly encircled the north’s main settlement Gaza City, has said that al-Shifa is the primary target in its battle to seize control of the northern half of the enclave. Israel says that Hamas fighters have an underground headquarters in tunnels beneath the hospital and are deliberately using its patients as a shield, a claim that Hamas denies. At least 650 patients remain, as well as staff, said Gaza’s Ministry of Health spokesperson Ashraf al-Qudra, who was inside al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City “We are besieged and are inside a circle of death,” he said. Israel also claimed that it attempted to evacuate babies from al-Shifa’s neonatal ward and left 300 litres (79 gallons) of fuel to power emergency generators at the hospital entrance, but that Hamas blocked the offer and prevented the hospital from using the fuel. “With ambulances unable to reach the hospital … and no hospital with capacity to receive them, there is no indication of how this can be done safely,” CEO Melanie Ward said. Hundreds of thousands of civilians are believed to remain in the northern part of Gaza where the fighting is focused, despite Israel’s order to leave. The order to leave the north amounted to a choice “whether to stay in your home, where your memories are and where you were born, and go to nowhere or be bombed”, said Ahmed, 42, reached by phone in the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza.

# Xi-Biden meeting to inject stability into troubled world economy

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1301758.shtml
<blockquote>
Amid such profound risks and challenges, the meeting between the Chinese and US leaders, a culmination of a flurry of official interactions over the past several months and a crucial sign of joint efforts to manage differences and stabilize ties, will offer a much-needed sense of stability for the world economy, Chinese analysts said on Monday. Moreover, at the 30th APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting, a key platform for economic cooperation in the Asia Pacific, China will reiterate its vision for and efforts to build open, inclusive regional and global economies and reject decoupling and protectionism, which will further help boost confidence in the region and globally, analysts noted. After China and the US announced on Friday that the two presidents will meet on the sidelines of the APEC Economic Leaders' meeting in San Francisco, global expectations for a constructive dialogue have been rising, even though some analysts remained cautiously optimistic about any potential breakthroughs. The two sides agreed to further strengthen communication and stressed that China and the US are not seeking economic decoupling, according to the Chinese Finance Ministry. "Solid conditions have been formed for the leaders' meeting to achieve some positive outcomes," Mei Xinyu, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, told the Global Times on Monday, "such positive outcome will offer stable expectations for the world economy." While the APEC region is expected to see a growth of 3.3 percent this year, up from 2.6 percent in 2022, "the legacy of the pandemic, inflation, higher debt, climate change, trade protectionism, geopolitical tensions, and economic fragmentation continue to overshadow outlook," the APEC Policy Support Unit said in a report on Sunday. "In the Asia Pacific, China and the US should both play their own roles and leverage their advantages to promote free trade.

# US, Japan, S.Korea defense chiefs agree to upgrade ties

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1301748.shtml
<blockquote>
Provocations by the US, Japan and South Korea against North Korea will further exacerbate tensions on the Korean Peninsula, making the situation more volatile and requiring more crisis management measures, Chinese experts warned on Monday, after defense chiefs from US, Japan and South Korea affirmed they would finalize a trilateral multi-year exercise plan by the end of 2023 and agreed to speed up the sharing of real-time data on North Korean missile launches, during a three-way security meeting. Although the three parties focused mainly on the Korean Peninsula, experts said the official release of the security meeting, which mentioned the Russia-Ukraine conflict and the Taiwan Straits, also reflected the US' real purpose of strengthening the alliance structure by intensifying the crisis, thus serving the strategic competition of great powers against China and Russia under the US' so-called Indo-Pacific Strategy. During his meeting with Austin on Monday, South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol called for a vigilant South Korea-US combined defense posture capable of promptly and decisively retaliating against any provocations from North Korea, according to a Yonhap report. Lü Chao, director of the Institute of US and East Asian Studies under Liaoning University, told the Global Times on Monday that after the Camp David summit, the US, Japan and South Korea formed a quasi-alliance military relationship, and increased military exercises conducted near the Korean Peninsula to further deter North Korea.

# GT Voice: Overcapacity hype won’t halt Chinese firms’ moves abroad

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1301773.shtml
<blockquote>
Against this backdrop, it is now crystal clear as to why there is a sudden wave of reports about China's mass investment in its domestic industries leading to overcapacity and dumping of low-cost products overseas. These reports are nothing but public opinion preparations for Western moves to squeeze the market for Chinese-made goods and adopt trade protectionism measures against Chinese manufacturing, because they are unwilling to share the market pie with Chinese companies. Chinese companies have not expanded their global market shares through any practices that do not conform to international norms. None of the unfair trade measures will stop Chinese manufacturing from making inroads into the global market and taking the shares that are appropriate for China's manufacturing advantages.

# What does David Cameron’s return to UK politics mean for the Middle East?

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/13/what-does-david-camerons-return-to-uk-politics-mean-for-the-middle-east
<blockquote>
Cameron, now foreign secretary, has previously called the Gaza Strip “a prison camp” and advocated for a two-state solution to the Israel-Palestine conflict, but he has also been a staunch backer of Israel. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak sacked Home Secretary Suella Braverman on Monday after she drew anger for accusing police of being too lenient with pro-Palestinian protesters and making comments described as “inflammatory”. Sign up for Al Jazeera Week in the Middle East Catch up on our coverage of the region, all in one place. “He is seen as having strong ties to strategic economic partners in the Middle East,” including an ongoing personal relationship with Saudi Arabia’s leadership, Whitman said. During his tenure as prime minister from 2010 to 2016, Cameron criticised Israel’s “illegal” settlements in the occupied West Bank and the blockade of the Gaza Strip. “Probably the most controversial foreign policy decisions during Cameron’s time as prime minister was the decision to use extrajudicial killings in Syria, which inaugurated a programme of drone strikes that continues to this day,” Whitham said. Since his resignation in 2016 after his unsuccessful bid for Britain to remain in the European Union, Cameron’s Middle East policy has been reviewed and found to have had a lasting impact for the region. In 2011 when Britain and France intervened in Libya, Cameron’s government said the operation was aimed at protecting civilians under fire from longtime leader Muammar Gaddafi.

# Chinese netizens engage in heated discussions over San Francisco's cleanup ahead of APEC

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1301777.shtml
<blockquote>
Chinese netizens joked online that the "about-face change" of San Francisco's clean street and the disappearance of homeless people demonstrate the city has the ability to address the malaise, but only seems willing to do so when an international summit is approaching, rather than for the sake of its own people. According to media reports on Friday, drug addicts, dealers and the homeless who have plagued San Francisco's downtown have miraculously disappeared as the APEC summit is held in the city starting from Saturday to Friday, while leaders from the 21-member APEC group are gathering to talk about how to better spur trade and economic growth across the Pacific region. This year marks the 30th anniversary of the APEC Summit and is also the largest summit held in San Francisco since 1945. According to the New York Post, the homeless have been pushed to other parts of the city in preparation for the APEC summit. According to media reports, since June of this year, San Francisco has begun to clean up the city, as it is not only a gathering place for homeless people but also a site for drug dealing and a thriving black market.

# Bombing of Gaza hospitals crosses the humanitarian bottom line: Global Times editorial

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1301781.shtml
<blockquote>
As a result of a fuel shortage, the death toll of critically ill patients and premature infants keeps rising, and "the hospital no longer functions as a hospital." It accused Hamas of using patients and medical staff as "human shields." It is also the bottom line of human civilization. According to the local health department, Al-Shifa Hospital has over 600 patients, including 40 premature infants in incubators. Now, every passing second in the Gaza hospital crisis signifies the loss of lives, and there is an urgent need for a larger-scale mobilization and organization of international calls for ceasefire and peace. It is obvious that as long as the artillery continues, the suffering there will only worsen, and it should not be so difficult for the international community to reach a basic consensus on this matter.

# Institutionalized US-Japan-S.Korea military cooperation a dangerous sign

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1301759.shtml
<blockquote>
The military cooperation between the US, Japan, and South Korea is moving toward a military alliance, which not only intensifies tension on the Korean Peninsula and confrontation in Northeast Asia, but also complicates and intensifies the situation in the Indo-Pacific region, seriously affecting regional peace and stability. If the trilateral military alliance between the US, Japan, and South Korea is truly established, it will pose a huge threat to peace and stability in Northeast Asia and even the Indo-Pacific region, experts warned. Zhan Debin, director and professor of the Center for Korean Peninsula Studies at the Shanghai University of International Business and Economics, told the Global Times that the development of the "multi-year trilateral exercise plan" agreed upon by the defense ministers of the US, Japan, and South Korea will intensify tension in Northeast Asia. The US-Japan-South Korea security cooperation could accelerate the NATO-ization of the Asia-Pacific region, which will not only have a significant negative impact on the security environment around China, but also on the cooperation process in East Asia.

# Detainees walk free after Australian High Court’s ‘life-changing decision’

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/14/detainees-walk-free-after-australian-high-courts-life-changing-decision
<blockquote>
Melbourne, Australia – Dozens of people have been walking out of immigration detention in Australia after the High Court ruled indefinite detention was illegal. Following the decision, 80 people – refugees as well as people held by immigration for other reasons – were released immediately into the community, with at least 92 more eligible for release. “This is a hugely significant decision, which will have life-changing consequences for people who have been detained for years without knowing when, or even if, they will ever be released,” Josephine Langbien, a senior lawyer at the Human Rights Law Centre, told Al Jazeera. “People who have lost years of their lives may finally have a chance at regaining their freedom and returning to their families and communities.” In comparison, the United States holds refugees for 55 days, while in Canada, refugees are held for just two weeks before a decision is made on whether they can remain in the country. As such, NZYQ remained in detention with no realistic prospect of removal and it was this indefinite detention the court ruled illegal under the Australian Constitution. Langbien also told Al Jazeera it was important to recognise that while NZYQ had committed a serious offence, he had served his sentence and should be released into the community like any other offender would be under domestic law. “Immigration detention is not prison,” she said. Yet, Langbien said this should never have been the case and that the ruling will extend to more than just people who are stateless, but to many who cannot return to their country of origin for reasons such as fear of persecution. “The High Court’s decision will bring about the release of people who should have been released many years ago,” she told Al Jazeera.

# ICC Cricket World Cup 2023: How India’s Siraj worked his way to the top

https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2023/11/14/india-cricket-mohammed-siraj-icc-cricket-world-cup-2023-semifinal
<blockquote>
When MS Dhoni swung his bat to a score a six and deliver India’s second ICC Cricket World Cup title at Mumbai’s Wankhede Stadium in 2011, more than 700km (434 miles) away in Hyderabad, a 16-year-old Mohammed Siraj was cultivating his dream of playing for India. On Wednesday, the 29-year-old will steam in with the ball in his hand as the world’s top one-day international (ODI) bowler when India take on New Zealand in the 2023 tournament’s first semifinal at the same storied venue. The tall and athletic pacer from Hyderabad in southern India has come a long way from bowling in slippers on dusty grounds to becoming a household name in the cricket-obsessed country. You need money to buy shoes, and I didn’t have any. Had I asked my parents to buy me shoes, they would have probably thrashed me with a pair,” he joked. “Once I was playing regular cricket, I used to go to the local ground on my bike while the other players arrived in big cars, and I would feel so ashamed of having to push-start my bike that I waited for every one to leave before making my way home,” he said. Siraj took three wickets as India beat Sri Lanka in their Cricket World Cup group match in Mumbai [Rafiq Maqbool/AP Photo] Special connection with Virat Kohli But it wasn’t only Rahul who saw him that day. “When I left home to join the [IPL] team, I told my brother to find a house for our family by the time I was back.” “Virat Bhai told me he couldn’t make it to the dinner because of a stiff back, and we are all heartbroken, but in fact he wanted to surprise me and my family.

# Gaza war pushes tumultuous Israel-Turkey ties into ‘deep freezer’

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/14/gaza-war-pushes-tumultuous-israel-turkey-ties-into-deep-freezer
<blockquote>
At a rally on October 28, Erdogan referred to Israel as a “war criminal” over its bombardment of Gaza since Hamas’s cross-border assault three weeks earlier. The relationship between Turkey and Israel since the latter’s formation has generally been characterised by warmer ties. But when Turkey recognised Palestine as a state in 1988 — becoming the first country with diplomatic ties with Israel to do so — it declined to grant the Palestinian envoy full diplomatic status, after Israeli complaints. By the 1980s, trade and tourism between Turkey and Israel were growing. In 1993, a Turkish foreign minister visited Israel for the first time. From the mid-1990s, there was close cooperation in the areas of defence and intelligence between the two states — both of which were closely supported by the United States and shared concerns about potential threats from neighbours such as Syria, Iraq and Iran. Turkey continued with its ties with Israel after the landslide election victory for Erdogan’s Justice and Development Party in 2002. But two years later, two events put a pause on those normalising efforts: dozens of Palestinian protesters were killed by Israeli security forces at the separation fence Israel built around Gaza and the US decided to move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Over the last two years, Erdogan has sought to improve the relationship with Israel as part of a wider foreign policy of smoothing over fractious ties with regional powers such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

We are doing everything we can to ensure the safety of our people in the region while supporting the communities where we operate.” McDonald’s Indonesia told Al Jazeera in a statement that it was “unwavering in its commitment to uphold the values of humanity and wants to take an active role in relief efforts in Gaza”. “I support the freedom of Palestine and humanitarian assistance to Palestine.”

This is the right humanitarian solution for the residents of Gaza and the entire region,” Smotrich wrote in a Facebook post on Tuesday. In their article on Monday, Danon and Ben-Barak said Europe had a long history of assisting refugees fleeing conflicts, and off of that example, “countries around the world should offer a haven for Gaza residents who seek relocation”. A majority of Palestinians were expelled from their homeland in 1948 during the creation of the state of Israel — an event they refer to as the Nakba, or “catastrophe”.

Kyiv, Ukraine – When Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, the world’s attention shifted from the Russian-Ukrainian war to the Middle East conflict. “We all clearly see that trophy arms from Ukraine have indeed been passed to the Hamas group. Sign up for Al Jazeera Week in the Middle East Catch up on our coverage of the region, all in one place. Israel’s offensive in Gaza has killed more than 11,200 Palestinians. “Russia has enough weapons to supply” its war effort in Ukraine and its allies in the Middle East, she claimed. The Russian leader took days to condemn Hamas’s assault, and in his first comments on the crisis blamed the “failure of the United States’ policy in the Middle East”. Primakov, a spy, would go on to become post-Soviet Russia’s foreign minister and then prime minister in the 1990s. But after millions of post-Soviet Jews moved to Israel, Israel began forging closer ties with Moscow. In a recent article, they wrote that given Russia’s welcome of a Hamas delegation in Moscow in October, its refusal to condemn the initial Hamas attack, and its close alliance with Iran, “Tel Aviv no longer considers Russia an ally and would probably reject it as a mediator.”

# Xi leaves for key China-US summit, APEC

<blockquote>
After arriving at the San Francisco International Airport, Global Times reporters saw welcoming signs such as "APEC is going to be epic. The APEC summit, which will be San Francisco's largest international gathering since 1945, is expected to draw 20,000 people to the city, according to media reports. Undoubtedly, during this year's APEC meetings, the interactions between the two major economies - China and the US - in San Francisco have captured the attention of the entire world, which is seen as one of the most significant diplomatic events in current international relations with its outcomes affecting bilateral relations and their future cooperation. Ahead of the high-stakes meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and US President Joe Biden this week, some US senior officials have attempted to dominate media narrative on the event, sharing their anticipation on "some of the most fundamental elements of the US-China relations." Raimondo noted the world is looking to the US and China "to be responsible and manage this relationship." The US released messages intensively ahead of the San Francisco summit "in order to set the tone for Xi-Biden meeting, as stabilizing the bilateral relations is an urgent need for the US; however, rivalry remains at the center place in its China policy," Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Monday. In addition to the informal APEC Leaders' Meeting, the APEC Senior Finance Officials' Meeting and the APEC CEO Summit are also scheduled to convene this week.

# Chinese finance minister hails economic recovery, continues talks with US at APEC

<blockquote>
Attending the APEC finance ministers meeting in San Francisco, the US, the Chinese finance minister met with several foreign officials, including US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, in yet another sign of increasing exchanges between Chinese and US economic officials ahead of a highly anticipated leaders meeting later this week. It's expected that the economy will maintain an upward trend in the fourth quarter, Lan said, adding that China is still an important driver of stable growth. While the MOF did not offer details on the meeting between Lan and Yellen as of press time, the US treasury secretary said that the meeting was "productive" and "another opportunity to deepen communication between our two countries." While commending the increasing exchanges between Chinese and US economic officials, Chinese analysts called on the US to clarify its position of calling for "healthy competition" and fulfill its promises with concrete actions. While Washington frequently stresses that it seeks "healthy economic competition" with China, it should give a clear definition of the phrase, Li said, noting that launching sweeping tariffs on Chinese goods, restricting exports of chips to China and seeking to build a "small yard, high fence" are in effect promoting decoupling and not healthy competition. "We believe that there is still considerable potential for China's growth in the global capital market, largely hinging on the openness of the Chinese capital market.

# Do not make the resettlement offer to Pacific a geopolitical chess move

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1301824.shtml
<blockquote>
Western countries are keen on using the South Pacific as a stage for geopolitical competition, treating island nations as pawns to counter China's influence. Australia announced on Friday a security guarantee to the Pacific Island nation of Tuvalu, which is threatened by rising sea levels. This indicates that the main concern of Australia and other former colonial powers is not climate change, economic development, or social stability in island nations, which are the primary demands of the islanders. Former colonial powers have always desired for island nations to refrain from engaging in South-South cooperation with emerging countries outside the region, and they want these countries to remain politically subservient to the West and economically reliant on the West, following their instructions and manipulation, Yu Lei, professor at Shandong University, told the Global Times. The symbolic significance of this practice is that Australia is willing to support affected island nations, and Tuvalu's case can be seen as a signal and temptation to other Pacific island countries - as long as they are willing to maintain close ties with Australia, they may receive similar support, said Chen Hong, director of the Australian Studies Centre at East China Normal University. Island nations welcome China and other emerging countries to engage in economic, trade, and development cooperation with them, as they aspire to achieve true political autonomy and economic independence.

Idlib, Syria — Syrian government forces and Russia have stepped up the bombardment of northwest Syria, killing dozens of people, including children, and wounding hundreds of others, opposition leaders and emergency volunteers have said, at a time when Israel’s war on Gaza is holding the world’s attention. “The military escalation by al-Assad regime, the Russians, and the Iranians against civilians in northern Syria has not stopped for a single day, but it intensifies and weakens from time to time based on international, regional, and local circumstances,” said Mustafa al-Bakour, a leader in Syrian opposition factions in northwest Syria, referring to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Al-Bakour told Al Jazeera that Russia and the Syrian regime exploited the world’s preoccupation with the war in Gaza to escalate in northwest Syria, aiming to exert pressure on Turkey and Syrian opposition factions regarding issues such as opening the international road between Syria and Turkey. “However, I am not ruling out the continuation of shelling operations by al-Assad and Russian forces on civilians in northern liberated Syria.”

# Recovery of Chinese cinema a chance for all

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1301842.shtml
<blockquote>
Although it looks unlikely for the box office this year to reach pre-pandemic 2019's 64 billion yuan, this shows the Chinese film market is on the path of quick recovery and has great potential for expansion. Though this is a new Disney story for the Chinese audience, the high popularity of actress Liu Yifei, who voices the protagonist Asha in the Chinese dub, may help the film see a bullish performance. The franchise starter Captain Marvel once grossed 1.04 billion yuan in 2019, the year MCU films reached their box office peak. The Hollywood Reporter has predicted that The Marvels will be lucky to top $20 million, or 146 million yuan, in the mainland. For example, Warner Bros' Barbie, shining a spotlight on women and their social anxieties, earned a healthy 252 million yuan in the Chinese mainland as the theme struck a chord with many cosmopolitan Chinese women. This phenomenon reveals that when foreign language films can find stories that resonate with Chinese audiences, they are more willing to buy in.

# Bangladesh’s ongoing political crisis is ‘high risk’ for fragile economy

<blockquote>
Now it has become 22,000 takas ($200) as very few truck owners are allowing their vehicles to ferry goods,” said Uddin. But if we do, then we will end up with unsold, rotten vegetables,” Uddin lamented. Hasina’s party — the Awami League — has been in power since 2009, and the last two general elections of 2014 and 2018, respectively, were marred with opposition boycotts and allegations of massive vote rigging. In 2011, the country’s parliament dissolved the caretaker government, a neutral election-time administration that had successfully conducted at least four elections since the South Asian nation’s democratic transition from military dictatorship in the early 90s. The escalating political standoff is causing serious concerns for the South Asian economy, which has already been squeezed by the global effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Now, the blockades are causing Bangladesh’s economy to lose 65 billion takas ($588m) a day, as per the Federation of Bangladesh Chambers of Commerce and Industry (FBCCI), the country’s apex trade body. The crisis this time will be even bigger.” This time it may hurt more not just because the economy is bigger, but also because the buffers are thin to begin with,” he said. Hussain, however, said the current economic crisis cannot be attributed to the political impasse only. “[It] has been there for more than 15 months and counting,” he said. “Blockades are obviously detrimental to the economy, but if we don’t fight to restore democracy now and allow another sham election, the economy as well as the whole country will be in bigger trouble,” he told Al Jazeera. Blaming the opposition or the global economy will not put an end to it, he added.

# Thousands trapped as Israeli forces raid Gaza’s al-Shifa Hospital

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/15/israeli-forces-raid-gazas-al-shifa-hospital-in-targeted-operation
<blockquote>
The raid “is considered to be very risky and dangerous as inside the hospital there are around 7,500 Palestinians including patients, doctors and displaced people,” he said. We know all the propaganda is lies, and they know as well as we do that there is nothing at al-Shifa medical centre.” The Palestinian government holds Israeli forces “responsible for the lives of the medical staff, patients, and displaced people in the al-Shifa complex,” she added. Hamas said that it holds Israel and US President Joe Biden responsible for the implications of the raid, labelling it a “barbaric crime against a medical facility protected by the fourth Geneva Convention”. Ardi Imseis, an international law expert at Queen’s University in Canada, said Israel carries the burden to “produce evidence” and prove its claim that the hospital has been used by Hamas as a base. Omar Shakir, the Israel and Palestine Director at Human Rights Watch, told Al Jazeera that “the Israeli government has put forward no evidence that would justify stripping hospitals of their special protections under international humanitarian law”.

# Hamas blames US for giving Israel ‘green light’ to raid al-Shifa Hospital

The accusation came in a statement on Wednesday, a day after the White House said US intelligence sources corroborated Israel’s claims that Hamas has buried an operational centre under the hospital. A further 5,000-7,000 displaced civilians are trapped inside the hospital grounds and under constant fire from Israeli snipers and drones, according to the health ministry. Spokesman Ashraf al-Qudra told Al Jazeera Arabic that “there are only doctors, patients and displaced people” inside al-Shifa. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu promised to destroy Hamas in response to its attacks on southern Israel on October 7, which killed an estimated 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw 240 captives being taken to Gaza.

# China reports 7.6% growth in retail sales in October, as world’s second-largest economy maintains strong recovery momentum

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1301890.shtml
<blockquote>
Photo: VCGTourists dance with artists at the Yotkan cultural scenic spot in Hotan County, northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, Nov. 7, 2023. With a raft of fiscal and financial stimulus to bear more fruits and a tone-setting meeting that outlines top policy priorities for the coming months, Chinese observers predict that the country's GDP growth could reach 5 percent or above in the fourth quarter, depending on how the 1-trillion-yuan ($138 billion) special treasury bonds issuance could be executed in 2023 and 2024. It accelerated from September's 5.5-percent expansion. The rosy-than-expected data was seen by analysts and officials as offering insights into the resilience of the economic recovery in the fourth quarter, of which October is the first month, as well as the soundness of economic fundamentals that would pave way for an upbeat economic start-off next year. Last year, the total retail sales of social consumer goods were 44 trillion yuan. Last week, the IMF moved to raise its projected growth rate for the Chinese economy to 5.4 percent for 2023, up by 0.4 percentage points compared with the organization's October projections. The 2024 GDP growth is projected to be 4.6 percent. In the first nine months, the index recorded a growth of 3.1 percent. While taking note of challenges at home and abroad, Liu said that in the coming months, China will take solid steps to carry out macro-regulation in a more targeted and effective way, and ramp up efforts to expand domestic demand, boost consumer and investor confidence and fend off risks. China is set to hold the tone-setting Central Economic Work Conference in December, which will examine the current economic situation and chart out a blueprint for next year.

# China calls for healthy, stable ties after UK’s Cameron returns

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1301843.shtml
<blockquote>
The Chinese Foreign Ministry on Tuesday congratulated former British prime minister David Cameron on his appointment as UK's foreign secretary after incumbent Prime Minister Rishi Sunak reshuffled his top team, calling on the two sides to work together to promote the healthy and stable development of China-UK relations. But it remains to be seen how far Cameron will follow his previous pragmatic line on China, as riding on China's economic development does not mean Cameron is particularly different from other Tory members in terms of values, they said. If the UK's Conservative government realizes there are obstacles and is willing to improve China ties, Cameron's experience and his visibility in China can play an important role, Cui said. According to Gao, Cameron's appointment probably means that Sunak hopes to use Cameron's political connections to play a constructive role in the China-UK relationship. The Sunak cabinet, and the wider Conservative party, has been wavering in its relationship with China, Gao said. Because the overall perception of China in the UK remains negative, the China hawks in British political scene still maintain considerable influence on the direction of China-UK relations, Dong Yifan, a research fellow at the Institute of European Studies, China Institutes of Contemporary International Relations, told the Global Times on Tuesday. Given their declining support, it is likely that the British government will be more inclined to be tough on China to secure short-term gains to secure power until the next general election, even if cooperation with China is what is good for the UK in the long run, Cui said.

Israel’s raid on Gaza’s al-Shifa Hospital has brought “terror and death” to the thousands trapped inside, witnesses say.

# Nature, infrastructure boost outdoor activities

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1301914.shtml
<blockquote>
According to the Outdoor Sports Industry Development Plan (2022-2025) issued by the General Administration of Sport of China, the total size of the outdoor sports and leisure activities industry is expected to surpass 3 trillion yuan ($414 billion) by 2025. As a consumption activity, it calls for money and time, which initially belonged to the "leisure class." The rise of outdoor sports in China has been synchronized with the growth of the middle class. Besides this, factors such as the indifference of interpersonal relationships have led to a stronger desire to return to nature. Thus, we can once again devote ourselves to society. Such target-oriented notes triggered many sportsmen's desire to go wild and create more related content, resonating with the public and radiating out to a broader group, causing more people to take part in outdoor activities. We escape our tense and routine social life, enjoy nature to refresh ourselves, and return to work with a more energetic body and positive attitude.

# Tibetan art a direct window for outside world to feel, understand and accept the real Xizang

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1301892.shtml
<blockquote>
As the only 3D altar city ancient architectural structure in Lhasa, the Jebum-Gang Art Center embodies the essence of Tibetan architecture, art, and history. No matter which side you listen from, you can hear the enchanting sound of the bells," the docent told the Global Times. "When I was young, this place was an ancient building in the bustling market of Lhasa, serving as grain storage for the residents. The four entrances separate the outer corridor into four sections. Photo: Courtesy of the Jebum-Gang Art Center Fang Kun, founder of the Jebum-Gang Art Center and director of the China Tibet Culture Protection and Development Association, shared the history of the art center in an interview with the Global Times. As the only remaining intact ancient building with a perfect Tibetan fortress structure in Lhasa, the "Jebum-Gang Lakang" - Lakang means "Buddhist temple" in Tibetan language - hidden in the bustling city has a legendary background. In 2018, the ancient Jebum-Gang Lakang attracted great attention from the cultural and tourism department of Lhasa, and restoration work on the cultural relics began. After multiple discussions, Fang's team decided to transform the Jebum-Gang Lakang into a contemporary cultural and tourism landmark in Xizang called the "Jebum-Gang Art Center," which focuses on contemporary art exhibitions, artist residencies, art displays, and public cultural education activities. "Yet the Tibetan people have their own traditional culture and a thriving contemporary cultural art scene, which is often overlooked." Fang and his team's vision of transforming the Jebum-Gang Lakang into an art center was soon recognized by the cultural and tourism department of Chengguan district in Lhasa. After consultations and expert discussions, the cultural and tourism department officially entrusted Fang's team with the responsibility of its transformation and operation, based on the principles of reusing ancient buildings for public welfare. In recent years, people of all ethnic groups in Xizang have actively participated in the protection and development of Tibetan culture. In frank communication, Taiwan visitors were impressed by the wisdom of the ancient people, the craftsmanship of folk artisans, and the creativity of modern artists, realizing that traditional Tibetan culture is brilliant and excellent, and modern Tibetan culture has been fully transmitted through the generations.

# China, US make 'breakthrough' agreement on tackling climate change, but US needs to do more

Chinese experts hailed the document titled "Sunnylands Statement on Enhancing Cooperation to Address the Climate Crisis" as a hard-earned achievement between the two countries amid a thaw in tensions. China and the US recognize that the climate crisis has increasingly affected countries around the world, remain committed to the effective implementation of the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement, reflecting equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in light of different national circumstances, to achieve the Paris Agreement's aims, which is to hold the global average temperature increase to well below 2 C and to pursue efforts to limit it to 1.5 C, according to the statement.

# What New Delhi can learn from Beijing in curbing hazardous smog

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1301886.shtml
<blockquote>
The article highlights that a range of "command-and-control measures" helped Beijing clean up its air, while Delhi's battle against air pollution stumbles due to inadequate planning, wrongly designed policies, and partisan politics. On the same day, the Swiss group IQAir released a ranking of the world's top 10 most polluted cities, with New Delhi once again topping the list with an Air Quality Index (AQI) of 407, classified as "hazardous." New Delhi is one of the world's most polluted cities, with air quality worsening every year before the arrival of winter. Although India has committed to global emission reduction plans, challenges related to employment in the coal industry, supporting infrastructure, and energy transition hinder the adoption of more forceful measures. Socially, China has established a green lifestyle, advocating for a nationwide adoption of a green way of life to reduce emissions. However, in recent years, influenced by border issues, India has reduced its efforts and willingness to cooperate with China on climate issues.

“It is the biggest international event ever hosted in the country because it leaves a tangible and long-lasting legacy that will change the lives of people in the Solomon Islands,” Christian Nieng, executive director of the Pacific Games National Hosting Authority (NHA), told Al Jazeera in an interview.

# Western donors cut off funding to Arab groups amid Israel’s war

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/16/western-donors-cut-off-funding-to-arab-groups-amid-israels-bombardment
<blockquote>
Beirut, Lebanon – Western donors are cutting Arab civil society groups off financially for criticising Israel’s atrocities in Gaza, or failing to back them up when they do, according to human rights activists. All humanitarian aid groups and civil societies that spoke to Al Jazeera said some Western donors had withdrawn financial support for Arab media outlets, human rights groups and think tanks. Al Jazeera spoke to civil society groups from Egypt, the occupied Palestinian territory and Lebanon who have spoken out against Israeli atrocities in Gaza. The pause amounts to $139m in lost funding and affects UN agencies, the Palestinian Authority governing the West Bank and a number of civil society organisations. Another Palestinian civil organisation, which also lost funding from the FDFA, partly attributed the decision to intense “lobbying” from NGO Monitor, an Israeli NGO. NGO Monitor took some credit for the FDFA’s decision on X (formerly Twitter) and has previously said its research was cited by Swiss parliamentarians calling for funding to be cut to Israeli human rights groups such as B’tselem which work for the welfare of Palestinians. Ayman Mhanna, executive director of the Samir Kassir Foundation (Skeyes), which advocates for press freedom across the Levant, said he was particularly disappointed in the UN Democracy Fund (UNDEF), which partners with his organisation but has been mostly silent on the issue of the Israeli bombardment of Gaza and violence in the West Bank. They have not taken action against independent media [that they support], but their silence isn’t something that’s really understandable right now,” he told Al Jazeera.

Chinese President Xi Jinping met with US President Joe Biden for a summit at the Filoli estate in the south of San Francisco on Wednesday local time. The success of each is an opportunity for the other." Xi pointed out that China's development follows its own logic and rules, and China is advancing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation through modernization in its own unique style. As long as both sides adhere to mutual respect, peaceful coexistence, and win-win cooperation, it is entirely possible to transcend differences and find the correct way for two major countries to coexist, Xi said. At last year's Bali meeting, the US side stated that it does not seek to change China's system, does not seek a "new Cold War," does not seek to oppose China by strengthening alliances, does not support "Taiwan independence," and has no intention of having conflict with China. On the Taiwan question, Xi emphasized that it remains the most important and sensitive issue in China-US relations, and China values the positive statements made by the US side during the Bali meeting. Diao added that if the US can adjust its understanding and truly adopt a responsible perspective, recognizing each other's positions, effectively managing differences, and advancing mutually beneficial cooperation, it will further stabilize the relations between the two countries.

# Biden to Netanyahu: ‘Occupying’ Gaza would be a ‘big mistake’

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/16/biden-to-netanyahu-occupying-gaza-would-be-a-big-mistake
<blockquote>
US President Joe Biden has said he had made it clear to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that occupying Gaza would be “a big mistake” and that the two-state solution was the only way to bring an end to the Israel-Palestinian conflict. Netanyahu said earlier this month that after the war Gaza would have to be “demilitarised, deradicalised and rebuilt” and that Israel would need to find a “civilian government” to govern the enclave, which has been run by Hamas since 2006. Speaking as the Israeli military continued its raid on Gaza’s al-Shifa Hospital, Biden said he had also discussed with Israeli leaders the need to “be incredibly careful” in its actions at the hospital, under which Israel says the Palestinian armed group Hamas had built its military headquarters. Israel has said it is not only looking for Hamas fighters but also the captives, including a three-year-old US citizen, who have been held in Gaza for more than a month.

# Xi, Biden concludes ‘strategic, historic and directional’ summit

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1301979.shtml
<blockquote>
After four hours of face-to-face, in-depth and comprehensive talks, the Chinese and US leaders concluded a significant China-US summit on Wednesday local time that is seen as strategic, historic and directional, forming a forward-looking "San Francisco vision" and setting the direction for a healthy, stable, and sustainable development of US-China relations. This China-US summit sent a positive and stable signal to the world, indicating that both China and the US are intent on easing and stabilizing bilateral relations and seeking opportunities for cooperation, some experts said. Whether this summit can be seen as an important milestone in the overall progress of bilateral relations, and whether the two countries can continue to move forward is the real test of the sincerity and determination of the US side, especially after the Chinese leader had articulated comprehensively China's stance on stabilizing and improving bilateral ties, Chinese experts said. "The two heads of state had a very good, comprehensive, and in-depth meeting at the Filoli estate," Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told a group of reporters after the summit on Wednesday. This time, the Chinese top leader openly and directly urged the US side to support China's efforts for "peaceful reunification," and this is a significant message to the US and the world, Jin noted. Biden said the US does not support "Taiwan independence" and has no intention to have a conflict with China. As for the future of China-US relations, Chinese experts are being cautious because there will be great uncertainties for the US next year.

Hebron, occupied West Bank – Eyad Banat, 35, was live on TikTok when dozens of Israeli soldiers raided his home and violently beat him and other family members in the city of Hebron in the southern occupied West Bank. They kept beating him on and on and then handcuffed him and took him,” Banat’s 10-year-old daughter, Sandy, told Al Jazeera from their home. Recalling the raid on his home, Banat said he was assaulted in the same way as his cousin. Sign up for Al Jazeera Week in the Middle East Catch up on our coverage of the region, all in one place. For 41 days, the enclave has been under a relentless aerial and ground bombardment by Israeli military forces which has killed more than 11,500 people, the majority of them women and children. It is so unfortunate that 22 [Arab] countries are not able to bring one bottle of water into Gaza. “When I was live, I realised the army was surrounding my house. Commenting on being assaulted in front of his children, Banat said they are “used to it” due to the frequent raids by the Israeli army and PA security services.

While defense chiefs from ASEAN members underscored the importance of maintaining regional peace and stability, and called for pursuing peaceful solutions to disputes during the ASEAN Defense Ministers' Meeting (ADMM) in Jakarta, the US continued to promote its "Indo-Pacific" strategy and vowed military support to allies on the sidelines of the ADMM events. In a joint statement released after the ADMM, ministers agreed to deepen defense and security cooperation among its members and between the association and its partner countries.

# GT Voice: Geopolitical factors can’t derail China’s financial development

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1302002.shtml

From Washington's ban on US investment in certain sensitive technologies in China, to a US government directive that halted a federal pension fund's plan to invest in Chinese stocks, media reports about internal forces in the US attempting to force a "decoupling" of financial investment between China and the US surface from time to time. In recent years, the expansion and development of China's financial market has been mainly driven by endogenous forces, such as economic growth, financial system reforms, financial innovation, market opening-up and financial supervision. It is because of the dynamics of these endogenous forces that China's expanding financial markets have attracted global investors including US pension funds in recent years. But still it is a pity for any investor to miss the opportunity of a growing market.

# 'The Satanic Verses': The long road to German publication

<blockquote>
When Salman Rushdie's fourth novel, "The Satanic Verses," appeared in its English-language first edition on September 26, 1988, the writer could not yet have imagined that this book would fundamentally change his life. "The Satanic Verses" in German "The fatwa led to paralysis in the publishing house," Helge Malchow, editor at the time and later publishing director, told DW. "I thought it was a crime not to publish the book," he said. German writer Hans Magnus Enzensberger turned to Widmann's friend Frank Berberich, publisher of the culture magazine Lettre International. "I thought it was a crime not to publish the book," Arno Widmann said After the Turkish writer Aziz Nesin announced that he would publish excerpts from Rushdie's book, Islamists carried out an arson attack on a culture festival in 1993 because Nesin was scheduled to be there. Back in 1989, about 100 publishing houses, writers' associations, editors and authors got together to found a new publishing house that would publish "The Satanic Verses" in German. The Article 19 publishing house, whose name refers to the freedom of expression in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, served the sole purpose of publishing Rushdie's novel. Bernhard Robben, who later translated several of Rushdie's works into German, told DW that, as much as he would have liked to translate the book, he struggled with the idea of living "in fear of death." Robben was living in Oxford at the time and he and Rushdie met and got along well. It was unthinkable to him that this book would not be published in German and that the attack on freedom of expression would succeed. Bernhard Robben, who co-translated "Joseph Anton," is in fact "pretty sure it wouldn't be published today."

# England's WSL: Is it living up to the hype?

https://www.dw.com/en/englands-wsl-is-it-living-up-to-the-hype/a-63286432
<blockquote>
But now these are the people that are interested in watching, those people are fans of the game and they will come to watch us again and again and again, I hope," she told DW, before striking a slightly more cautious note. I question it because it has to be fixture-friendly with the men's team and there's a lot of things [to fall in to place for] a day like today." But a somewhat unforeseen effect of affordable tickets and increased demand has been empty seats at sold out games. Though several WSL clubs have sold out their season tickets for games that are, for the most part, at much smaller stadiums, there is a suggestion that some fans buy them to secure a few key games in a season and won't necessarily attend every match. "I think we've now entered that phase of women's football becoming a business," said the head coach of WSL champions Chelsea, Emma Hayes, after the Euros win. "The next step is the league leaving the FA and going to the Premier League or an independent body and that there is a vision around the women's game so we don't just have single big moments – single events once every two years or once a year – that they're every week." For now though, with the exception of a handful of clubs in Spain, France and Germany, it's clear the combination of money, better facilities and bigger crowds have made the WSL the destination of choice for the world's best players. "We can now start pushing in that competition as a league, WSL, in the Champions League," said Williamson to DW before Arsenal snuck past Ajax and in to the group stage. "And from our perspective that's where we should be."

"We do not consider it acceptable that you are threatened by a neighbor with military force, to be forced into unwanted cooperation," he said. However, analyst Barkin said there is a risk that Germany is unprepared for the fallout of a conflict in the Taiwan Strait. "But there is a risk that Germany is just as unprepared for a conflict in the Taiwan Strait as it was for Vladimir Putin's invasion. There is a lot more work to do at the national and European levels to prepare for Taiwan scenarios," he added. The German delegation's visit this week carries both symbolic importance and substance, said Marcin Jerzewski, head of the Taiwan Office of the Center for European Values, the EU's official representation in Taiwan. "The fact that the German delegation coming to Taiwan is a cross-partisan delegation sends a message that it is normal to engage with Taiwan and it is normal to foster people-to-people relations because this is inherently what parliamentary delegations do," he added. "While the lawmakers don't represent the German government's official position, the cross-partisan nature of the delegation shows there is cross-party support for Taiwan in the German parliament." During the remainder of the trip, the German delegation is expected to visit Taiwan's parliament, hold meetings with local security think tanks and visit Tainan Science Park in the southern part of the island.

# European farmers struggle to contain deadly bird flu

https://www.dw.com/en/european-farmers-struggle-to-contain-deadly-bird-flu/a-63302531
<blockquote>
Poultry farmer Alrik Visscher from Dalfsen in the eastern part of the Netherlands is one of the farmers who has lost all his birds because of the flu. There have been regular outbreaks of this sickness, which is deadly for many birds, for more than year, though normally, the bird flu season in Europe lasts from October until April or May. In the Netherlands alone, more than 4 million chickens and ducks had to be culled, while hundreds of thousands wild birds have died. Barely any European country escaped cases of bird flu among wild birds or poultry since the beginning of this season in October 2021. Just like in the Netherlands, where the density of poultry farms is among the highest in Europe. According to the EFSA, high poultry density is one of the factors leading to a faster spread of the virus, which usually comes from Asia via migratory wild birds spending the winter in Europe. A positive test at one farm leads to the installation of a 3-kilometer-wide-protection zone in which all farms have to prove they have no bird flu – and at affected farms all birds are culled as the virus is highly infectious. Measures like quarantines and early cullings of animals on the farms can lower the threat of a spread – but they cannot contain it completely. The only hope among bird conservationists and farmers is now: A vast spread of the virus leading to a high immunity among the local birds. New hygiene measures are to be announced; only then can new birds arrive.

# What does the Nord Stream pipeline gas leak mean for the environment?

https://www.dw.com/en/what-does-the-nord-stream-pipeline-gas-leak-mean-for-the-environment/a-63268348
<blockquote>
The gas from the Nord Stream pipeline leaks would have been burned for energy use regardless of the leak, so it is unlikely that more emissions were released than normal. Research has found that methane emissions are 80 times worse than carbon dioxide emissions over a 20 year scale — and that they already account for roughly 30% of global warming. Human activity over the past 150 years has prompted a huge rise in artificial greenhouse gas emissions, causing global temperatures to soar at an alarming rate. Data show that the impact of a man-made climate crisis from greenhouse gas emissions is already being felt around the world — including in Germany. At the UN global climate conference COP26 late last year, more than 100 nations pledged to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030. Nord Stream 1 and 2 are now shut down indefinitely because of the leaks — but many countries in Europe, including Germany, rely on these gas pipelines for energy.

# Methane gas: What's the big deal?

https://www.dw.com/en/methane-gas-whats-the-big-deal/a-59059353
<blockquote>
While the gas, also known as CH4, has become almost synonymous with cattle flatulence, there's actually much more to it than that. Scientists estimate that although methane only accounts for 3% of emissions since 1750, it is linked to as much as 23% of historic warming. In other words, the stuff is potent. Partly, but not only, as a result of gassy livestock, the agricultural sector causes the same amount of warming as 788 million cars, which is more than half of the world's 1.4 billion-strong fleet. And what's more, the natural gas saved from patching up the leaks would more than pay for the upgrades. And at least we can use methane to burn. Not when we could be talking permafrost. Thing is, as the Arctic heats up, areas of Earth that have been locked in frozen slumber for many millennia, are starting to thaw. Some of this former icescape then transforms into new wetlands, which release methane into the atmosphere, helping temperatures to rise. Thawing permafrost could increase non-human methane emissions by 80%. But even as individuals we can make a contribution by (whether we like it or not), cutting back on burgers, palm oil and flying. But that, we have seen by now, is the one thing the planet cannot afford to let happen.

# Elon Musk deal to buy Twitter for $44 billion is back on

https://www.dw.com/en/elon-musk-deal-to-buy-twitter-for-44-billion-is-back-on/a-63332657
<blockquote>
Trading in shares of Twitter was halted on Tuesday following reports that Elon Musk would proceed with his $44 billion (roughly €44 billion) deal to buy the company. A trial between the two parties was scheduled to start on October 17, with Twitter seeking to compel Musk to go through with the deal and Musk accusing the company of fraud in a countersuit. "This is a clear sign that Musk recognized heading into Delaware Court that the chances of winning vs. Twitter board was highly unlikely," Dan Ives, an analyst at investment bank Wedbush, wrote in a note to investors. The news also coincides with the outspoken billionaire attracting negative attention for comments about Russia's invasion of Ukraine, posted on Twitter.

# Depeche Mode to release new album and go on world tour

https://www.dw.com/en/depeche-mode-to-release-new-album-and-go-on-world-tour/a-63329463
<blockquote>
The band's remaining permanent members, guitarist and keyboardist Martin Gore and lead singer Dave Gahan, announced in Berlin on October 4 that they will release a new album "towards the end of March" and embark on a world tour. Yet, in their early years, the band was dismissed as synth-pop pinups: a boy band that was unlikely to last. Depeche Mode then went on to sell more than 100 million albums, winning over a global audience with hit singles such as "Personal Jesus," "People Are People" or "Enjoy The Silence." Depeche Mode Speaking to an NME journalist in West Germany in 1984, Andy Fletcher said: "The last time we refused an interview with them, they made up a story about Dave having to be carried off stage at the end of every performance, taken to a separate dressing room and kept supplied with constant fluids. "It sometimes feels a bit strange to be able to do this," Gahan said, "but to be able to walk on a stage and bring some joy to a lot of people is something that we are pretty proud of.” "For sure he'll be there in spirit — or, you know, judging us," Gahan laughed.

# Opinion: Lula's rhetoric also threatens Brazilian democracy

https://www.dw.com/en/opinion-lulas-rhetoric-also-threatens-brazilian-democracy/a-63303021
<blockquote>
One that is not too dissimilar to that of right-wing populist President Jair Bolsonaro, who claims Brazil faces a rigged election — an accusation for which he has presented no evidence. While Bolsonaro and is wife Michelle claim they must protect Brazil from demons, the devil and Communism, and accuse Lula of being a thief, Lula says the country faces the danger of fascism, the Ku Klux Klan, and illiberalism. Both figures' dismal track records explain why this election campaign has been accompanied by such shrill populist rhetoric. After four years under the inept leadership of Bolsonaro, Brazilian society finds itself in crisis. And his decision to have Brazil host the football world cup and Olympic games, while the country's hospitals and schools fell into disrepair, caused severe economic problems and social tensions. Additionally, the piece stated President Bolsonaro came to power following a 2019 election — the vote where he was elected president took place in 2018 and he assumed office on January 1, 2019.

The UN refugee agency on Tuesday said it was giving its highest award to former Chancellor Angela Merkel for her decision to welcome more than a million refugees, mostly from Syria, into Germany. Germany received about 1.2 million refugees and migrants in 2015 and 2016, when the Syrian Civil War was at its height. Merkel's decision not to close the door to migrants was linked to a rise in support for the far-right Alternative for Germany party.

Hossein Mahini, another Iranian international, was arrested and his home searched after he offered support for the protests that followed the death of Mahsa Amini. Fans of Karimi's former club, Bayern Munich, offered support to the protests in Iran when during Friday's Bundesliga match against Bayer Leverkusen, fans unfurled a banner that read: "Women, Life, Freedom! Solidarity with the feminist revolution in Iran!" Iranian athletes from other sports are also standing up to those in power. Sadjad Estaki, who in 2015 became the first Iranian to play in Germany's renowned national handball league, announced his resignation from the Iranian national team in protest of the heavy-handed response to Iranian demonstrations. For the national team, which is the center of the sporting world for the football-loving people of Iran, support is crumbling shortly before the World Cup in Qatar. "This state not only refuses to respect fundamental rights and human dignity. Many people around the world have been showing solidarity with the protesters in Iran.

# New film shows why Marilyn Monroe was so much more than a sex symbol

Having premiered at the 2022 Venice Film Festival and been released in cinemas in the US on September 16 and in the UK on September 23, many critics have already celebrated the film, and especially the performance of the lead, Cuban-born Ana de Armas. Actress Ana de Armas was lauded for her portrayal of Monroe Professionally, her come-hither looks, breathy voice — a strategy suggested by a speech therapist to overcome a stutter — and the sexuality-driven roles she landed, reduced her to a two dimensional character that pandered primarily to male fantasies. The film depicts the actress's fraught relationships with the men in her life Originally held up as an example of why feminism was necessary to counter the sexual exploitation and objectification of women, she has since been recognized for her own demands for self-determination.

Some residents accused France of working with Damiba to conduct a coup within a coup on Saturday. Praise for Captain Traore Adib said it was sad that terrorists were winning in Burkina Faso. "It's what has resulted or culminated in the coups we are witnessing, particularly in Mali and Burkina Faso," Adib added. He added that France and other Western partners seem to be becoming unpopular and that governments in the region are looking to ignite relationships with countries that they believe will bring a new dynamic.

<blockquote>
Hardly anyone is asking her advice on the worrying state of world affairs, presumably also because one cannot help feel she left her successor Olaf Scholz, of the Social Democrats, and his coalition government to sort out a big mess when she left. For a decade and a half, Merkel did nothing to reduce Germany's dependence on Russian energy. And in 2015, she kindly opened German borders to refugees, mainly of them Syrian, yet failed to work out how to better manage long-term immigration. These care-free times, after all, are over. Speaking at the opening of the Helmut Kohl Foundation in Berlin this week, she said one must take Putinseriously, and think about what will follow when the war ends. Germany has radically changed in the months since Merkel left office.

# European farmers struggle to contain deadly bird flu

https://www.dw.com/en/european-farmers-struggle-to-contain-deadly-bird-flu/a-63302531
<blockquote>
Poultry farmer Alrik Visscher from Dalfsen in the eastern part of the Netherlands is one of the farmers who has lost all his birds because of the flu. There have been regular outbreaks of this sickness, which is deadly for many birds, for more than year, though normally, the bird flu season in Europe lasts from October until April or May. In the Netherlands alone, more than 4 million chickens and ducks had to be culled, while hundreds of thousands wild birds have died. Barely any European country escaped cases of bird flu among wild birds or poultry since the beginning of this season in October 2021. Just like in the Netherlands, where the density of poultry farms is among the highest in Europe. According to the EFSA, high poultry density is one of the factors leading to a faster spread of the virus, which usually comes from Asia via migratory wild birds spending the winter in Europe. A positive test at one farm leads to the installation of a 3-kilometer-wide-protection zone in which all farms have to prove they have no bird flu – and at affected farms all birds are culled as the virus is highly infectious. In rare cases, mammals also caught the bird flu, but the risk for humans is very low, according to the EFSA. The only hope among bird conservationists and farmers is now: A vast spread of the virus leading to a high immunity among the local birds. New hygiene measures are to be announced; only then can new birds arrive.

# What does the Nord Stream pipeline gas leak mean for the environment?

https://www.dw.com/en/what-does-the-nord-stream-pipeline-gas-leak-mean-for-the-environment/a-63268348
<blockquote>
The gas from the Nord Stream pipeline leaks would have been burned for energy use regardless of the leak, so it is unlikely that more emissions were released than normal. Research has found that methane emissions are 80 times worse than carbon dioxide emissions over a 20 year scale — and that they already account for roughly 30% of global warming. Human activity over the past 150 years has prompted a huge rise in artificial greenhouse gas emissions, causing global temperatures to soar at an alarming rate. Data show that the impact of a man-made climate crisis from greenhouse gas emissions is already being felt around the world — including in Germany. At the UN global climate conference COP26 late last year, more than 100 nations pledged to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030. Nord Stream 1 and 2 are now shut down indefinitely because of the leaks — but many countries in Europe, including Germany, rely on these gas pipelines for energy.

# Methane gas: What's the big deal?

https://www.dw.com/en/methane-gas-whats-the-big-deal/a-59059353
<blockquote>
While the gas, also known as CH4, has become almost synonymous with cattle flatulence, there's actually much more to it than that. Scientists estimate that although methane only accounts for 3% of emissions since 1750, it is linked to as much as 23% of historic warming. In other words, the stuff is potent. Partly, but not only, as a result of gassy livestock, the agricultural sector causes the same amount of warming as 788 million cars, which is more than half of the world's 1.4 billion-strong fleet. And what's more, the natural gas saved from patching up the leaks would more than pay for the upgrades. And at least we can use methane to burn. Not when we could be talking permafrost. Thing is, as the Arctic heats up, areas of Earth that have been locked in frozen slumber for many millennia, are starting to thaw. Some of this former icescape then transforms into new wetlands, which release methane into the atmosphere, helping temperatures to rise. Thawing permafrost could increase non-human methane emissions by 80%. But even as individuals we can make a contribution by (whether we like it or not), cutting back on burgers, palm oil and flying. But that, we have seen by now, is the one thing the planet cannot afford to let happen.

# What is a ‘human shield’ and why is Israel using the term in Gaza?

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/13/what-is-a-human-shield-and-why-is-israel-using-the-term-in-gaza
<blockquote>
In its defence, the Israeli army has accused the Palestinian resistance group Hamas, which has governed the Gaza Strip since 2007, of using civilians as human shields. Israel has, however, not provided concrete proof for its allegations. The Israeli army has used this argument to issue evacuation orders to the entire northern part of Gaza as well as protected facilities including al-Shifa Hospital, Gaza’s largest medical facility, and to cast them as legitimate targets. What are human shields? There are three kinds of human shields: Voluntary shields are people who willfully choose to stand in front of a legitimate target as a means of protection; Involuntary shields are people who are coercively deployed as bargaining chips or as a means to thwart an attack; and proximate shields are civilians or civilian sites that become shields or are cast as shields due to their proximity to the fighting. Neve Gordon, co-author of Human Shields: A History of People in the Line of Fire, told Al Jazeera that evacuation orders give the warring party that issued it – in this case Israel – the ability to cast families like ElSayed’s and the entire population of northern Gaza as proximate human shields. Marc Weller, chair of international law and international constitutional studies at the University of Cambridge, said that if 1,000 people were sheltering at a site that was proven to hide a Hamas presence, Israel would have to send soldiers in to only hit the enemy assets (principle of distinction). Can Israel legally strike a hospital if it is used to shield a military target? Hospitals are protected under humanitarian law, but this status can be lost if their premises are used for military purposes.

The left-wing peer also disagreed with Starmer’s decision to suspend Labour MP Andy McDonald after he referenced “from the river to the sea” during a speech at a pro-Palestinian rally last month. He added: “The secretary of state has signalled to the whole scientific community that any of us who criticise the UK government and call for a ceasefire in Gaza are in danger of being publicly labelled, by a government minister, as an extremist and supporter of terrorism.” But Bennett told Al Jazeera that “the UK government’s assault on freedom of speech did not begin with the secretary of state’s October 28 letter to UKRI”. Bennett continued: “I have been told by students and colleagues at universities about a range of repressive techniques that university managers, under pressure from government, are using to prevent students and staff holding events in solidarity with the people of Gaza.” He also claimed to “have seen an all-staff email at [another] university, sent by their most senior administrator, that smeared a student rally in solidarity with Palestine as likely to be supportive of Hamas terrorism, with no reason given for thinking this other than that the rally was pro-Palestinian”. But a SOAS spokesperson told Al Jazeera that “the small number of suspensions relate” to students “violating our health and safety protocol”.

# China's economy to thrive with implementation of robust macro policies

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1301767.shtml
<blockquote>
Zhou Maohua, an economist with China Everbright Bank, told the Global Times on Monday that the October credit and total social financing data exceeded market expectations, showing strong momentum. "The financial data reflected a sustained recovery in domestic demand and boosted market confidence in the prospects of an economic recovery," Zhou said. A study by CITIC Securities said that the combined effect of the Mid-Autumn Festival and the National Day holidays drove strong growth in retail sales in October, with a year-on-year rise of about 7.9 percent. It was also up 1.5 percent from 2019. The recovery was stable in October and the uptrend will continue in the final two months of the year, Zhou Mi, a senior research fellow at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, told the Global Times on Monday. "To put the Chinese economy on the track of steady growth, it is crucial to tap new growth potential and release the current potential.

# Xi’s reply letter to Philadelphia Orchestra praises cultural envoy for connecting two peoples

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1301751.shtml
<blockquote>
When Chinese President Xi Jinping replied to a letter from Matias Tarnopolsky, president and CEO of the Philadelphia Orchestra, on November 10, the friendship of half a century was further strengthened through the art of music. The concert was performed by the Philadelphia Orchestra and the China National Symphony Orchestra. Ahead of Friday's special concert, the letter was read inside the concert hall, in which President Xi expressed hopes that orchestras and artists from China, the US, and across the world would persist in efforts to strengthen people-to-people ties between China and the US, and spread friendship among the peoples of the world. "It's going to be an important meeting, and we're very much looking forward to it and receiving President Xi in our country," Tarnopolsky said on the day of the concert. "It is an honor for the Philadelphia Orchestra to receive a letter from President Xi in this moment of 50 years of visits to China. In 1973, the China National Symphony Orchestra gifted a Chinese traditional instrument, the gong, to the Philadelphia Orchestra when the latter toured China. In his reply, President Xi said that he hopes the orchestra and artists from China, the US, and across the world will continue efforts to strengthen people-to-people ties between China and the US, and spread friendship among the peoples of the world. Ryan Fleur, executive director of the Philadelphia Orchestra, told the Global Times on Friday that the 50th anniversary celebration was a collaborative endeavor from both sides, which was made possible by the invitation from The Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries that has been their partner since 1973. Visits by the Philadelphia Orchestra to China over the years have been very influential to musicians from the two countries. Eugene Ormandy, the then conductor of the Philadelphia Orchestra until 1980, and other US musicians watched a performance by their Chinese counterparts on September 15, 1973. He then handed his baton to Ormandy and requested that he conduct the next movement. This can be said to have been a worldwide cooperation," said Zhu. When musicians had talks after the performances, US musicians were particularly surprised when they saw the musical instruments that their Chinese counterparts held, recalled Yang. Chinese musicians were moved when their US counterparts presented them with instruments such as a clarinet, trumpet, flute, and a set of triangles, as well as scores of famous European and American composers, and hundreds of records and orchestra's professional books. Zhu recalled: "The indispensable Chinese musical instrument is the gong.

# China solicits opinions on punishment measures for telecom scammers

People who will be punished by the draft measures include individuals who have been criminally punished for engaging in telecommunications fraud, or assisting in cybercrime related to telecommunications fraud, disrupting credit card management, infringing upon citizens' personal information, concealing and hiding criminal proceeds and gains, as well as organizing others to illegally cross national borders. In 2023, the Chinese public security department has been stepping up efforts to combat telecom and online fraud. Considering telecom and online fraud cases that usually involve a large number of offenders, the joint disciplinary measures combine punishment and warnings, such as setting up blacklist mechanisms, to serve as a long-term warning and increase the cost of their offenses, Zhu told the Global Times on Monday.

# Airlines announce more direct flights between China, US ahead of APEC summit

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1301754.shtml

The airline also plans to increase the number of flights between Beijing and Los Angeles to three a week from November 30. "Such exchanges are good for both countries as the trade and economic relationships of the two countries are of a win-win nature," Zhang said. In October, the US Department of Transportation (USDOT) said that Chinese airlines could fly 35 weekly round-trip flights after November 9, up from 24. In May, the USDOT announced that it would allow Chinese airlines to operate 12 round-trip flights from the previous eight, and then announced in August that it would allow the number of Chinese passenger flights to the US to be increased to 18 per week, and from October 29 to 24 round-trip flights per week. For its part, the Chinese Embassy in Washington said that "direct flights are vital to increasing visits between the people of China and the US, and we hope that the resumption of more flights will benefit the movement of people and trade between the two countries."

# Anti-Palestinian sentiment rises amid bipartisan US support for Israel

Last week, the war in Gaza dominated the third Republican presidential debate, where competing candidates were unanimous in their support of Israel. “There is a bipartisan effort to dehumanise the Palestinian people,” said Ahmad Abuznaid, the executive director of the US Campaign for Palestinian Rights (USPCR). “Whether they fail to mention Palestinians, question our death tolls, attack our students and protests, or censure the only Palestinian American representative in Congress, their attempts to silence us won’t work,” Abuznaid said.

To highlight the solid bipartisan support for Israel, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) has been sharing videos of left-wing Senator Bernie Sanders expressing opposition to a ceasefire in Gaza. “It’s interesting because when the only Palestinian member of Congress calls for an end to the violence and a ceasefire, she’s literally censured,” Mubarak told Al Jazeera, referring to Tlaib. “The movements and the masses of people — and the rare people who are serving in Congress and in state, local, federal positions — are trying to interrupt and disrupt the status quo,” she said, referring to Palestinian rights supporters. Abuznaid, of the USPCR, echoed Mubarak’s comments, saying that unwavering support for the Israeli government could fracture the political left and estrange the Palestinian rights movement.

# ‘Patients are dying’: What we know about Gaza hospitals under Israeli siege

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/13/patients-are-dying-what-we-know-about-gaza-hospitals-under-israeli-siege
<blockquote>
At least 32 patients, including six premature babies, have died at the al-Shifa Hospital in the last three days, Palestinian Health Ministry spokesperson Ashraf al-Qudra said Monday, as Gaza’s largest medical facility was forced to shut down due to lack of fuel and medicine. All hospitals in northern Gaza are now “out of service”, as relentless Israeli air strikes have killed more than 11,000 people, most of them women and children, triggering global calls for a ceasefire. What is happening at al-Shifa Hospital? The Israeli military is calling on people to leave the hospital. Hamas denied that it refused the fuel and said the hospital was under the authority of Gaza’s Ministry of Health. At least 21 of Gaza’s 35 hospitals have stopped functioning, either because of Israel’s siege on them, or because of a lack of fuel and medicines as a consequence of the total blockade imposed by Israel on Gaza since October 7. Al-Quds has been struggling to care for patients, with access to limited medicine, food and water. Mustafa al-Kahlout, head of both hospitals said: “We are completely surrounded, there are tanks outside the hospital, and we cannot leave.” On Friday, more than a dozen children and their parents or guardians were evacuated from the al-Rantisi Hospital to hospitals in neighbouring Egypt and Jordan, according to the UN. It remains unclear what has happened to the 30 children who remain at al-Nasr Hospital. Its director, Atef al-Kahlot, told Al Jazeera on Sunday that the 110-bed hospital is only operating at 30-40 percent of its capacity. “We call on the honourable people of the world, if any of them are left, to put pressure on the occupation forces to supply the Indonesian Hospital and the rest of the hospitals in the Gaza Strip,” he said.

# US and Iran-backed groups trade fire in Syria. Will it get worse?

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/14/us-and-iran-backed-groups-trade-fire-in-syria-will-it-get-worse
<blockquote>
Iran-backed groups have attacked US forces in Syria and Iraq more than 50 times since the start of the Gaza war, with several attacks coming this week, according to US military officials. Are attacks directly linked to Israel’s war on Gaza? US officials have tried to emphasise that Pentagon strikes against the Iran-backed groups are not directly connected with the Gaza war. The US has been retaliating against those strikes. Iran has been repeatedly warning since the start of the war in Gaza that “new fronts” will be opened if Tel Aviv refuses to stop bombing civilians in the besieged strip, and the “resistance axis” – regional political and armed groups allied with Tehran – forces may strike. Hamidreza Azizi, a fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs (SWP), said the attacks by Iran-backed groups are part of the response of the axis to the war in Gaza. “In this way, it seems that Iran and its allies are trying to force the Biden administration to reconsider its approach to the war in Gaza by increasing costs for the United States, and indirectly pressuring Israel to stop its attacks.” So far, the attacks on US forces in Syria have not caused serious damage. The only casualty the US forces have suffered was reported in Iraq.

# Why is gang violence rising in France’s Marseille?

Marseille, France – “Our society is in a state of emergency,” Hugo Cadet, a lawyer, says in a brasserie in the Old Port in Marseille. She was the third innocent civilian killed in similar incidents this year. Cadet has served on numerous criminal cases with young people on trial, and Hammou’s organisation offers the city’s families and young people help with administrative procedures, job searches and general support. “I think that the two successive mayors [before Benoit Payan, the current mayor] … voluntarily built an unbalanced city between a north, where ‘undesirable’ people were sent, and richer areas with the aristocracy and bourgeoisie,” Cadet said. “Prison is the school of crime” is an apt saying, according to Cadet, who notes, “I think that today someone who arrives in prison – he is more likely to take a path of delinquency than ultimately to deviate from it.” Advertisement Why is France facing a lawsuit over Marseille, and what do shark attacks have to do with anything?

# Out of medicines, care: Gaza’s cancer patients face death amid Israel war

<blockquote>
She had been treated at Al Makassed Hospital in occupied East Jerusalem, and following a successful yet complicated surgery, she returned to the Gaza Strip on October 5, two days before the war began. Barbakh, who is from the town of Bani Suhaila east of Khan Younis, was initially recovering at the Turkish-Palestinian Friendship Hospital, the only one for cancer treatment in the Gaza Strip. Barbakh was among 70 cancer patients evacuated from the hospital to go south, but after her house was damaged as a result of Israeli bombing – turning much of the area into a ghost town – she and her family had no choice but to stay at a shelter school. Overall, the 2,000 cancer patients in the Gaza Strip are living in “catastrophic health conditions as a result of the ongoing Israeli aggression on the Strip and the mass displacement”, al-Kaila said. But some of the cancer patients have asked to join their families in the shelter schools to die among them because they know that the hospitals cannot provide them with treatment, he added. “They stand with us and tell us they are with us, but their eyes are full of sadness and helplessness from how much we are suffering,” he said. Before October 7, Sukeyk said, he handed the Health Ministry about 1,000 medical referrals for cancer patients every year for their proper treatment and care in more specialised hospitals outside the besieged territory. Sukeyk said some of the cancer patients who were waiting for their medical permits have died, but is unable to confirm the exact number because of the chaos of the war. “I cannot move or even stand due to the deterioration of my health and the lack of painkillers necessary for my condition,” she said, speaking from Khan Younis after she was displaced from her home in Gaza City.

# Thai government defends Chinese police cooperation proposal; Western media’s hype of ‘sovereignty concern’ ill-intentioned and unfounded: experts

<blockquote>
After individual Western media's hype of "sovereignty concern" over the potential police cooperation between China and Thailand, a Thai government spokesperson, in the latest response on Monday, has defended the proposal that Chinese police operate alongside Thai police to help protect visiting Chinese tourists, but denied that Chinese police would accompany its Thai counterpart on patrol. The spokesperson Chai Wacharonke said criticism that the presence of Chinese police would be tantamount to Thailand giving up its independence and sovereignty was unfounded, the Thai media outlet Bangkok Post reported. Chai said the idea of the cooperation with Chinese police was raised by Royal Thai Police (RTP) representatives during a meeting on security for Chinese tourists with Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin at Suvarnabhumi airport on Sunday. The Thai spokesperson's remarks came after a Thai media outlet The Nation reported that Thapanee Kiatphaibool, director of the Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT), announced on Sunday a decision to invite Chinese police officers to participate in patrols in several tourist cities in a bid to boost the confidence of Chinese tourists. Western media's hype is over-interpreted and unfounded, Xu said, noting that police cooperation will be maintained in compliance with relevant Thai laws and regulations and so it will be impossible to affect Thailand's independence or sovereignty.

<blockquote>
list 2 of 4 US government shutdown imminent as lawmakers scramble to reach agreement list 3 of 4 With a US government shutdown imminent, what happens to the economy? list 4 of 4 What is a US government shutdown and who will be affected? Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, said in a statement after the vote that he was pleased the bill passed “with a strong bipartisan vote,” adding that he would work with his Senate Republican counterpart, Mitch McConnell, to pass it “as soon as possible”. The stopgap spending bill would extend government funding at current levels into early 2024 in a two-part process that temporarily funds some federal agencies to January 19 and others to February 2, giving lawmakers more time to craft the detailed spending bills that cover everything from the military to scientific research.

# Yemen’s Houthis say they fired ballistic missiles towards Israel

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/14/yemens-houthis-say-they-fired-ballistic-missiles-towards-israel
<blockquote>
Yemen’s Houthi rebels have launched ballistic missiles on various Israel targets, including in the Red Sea city of Eilat, the group’s military spokesperson has said. “Our eyes are open to constantly monitor and search for any Israeli ship in the Red Sea, especially in Bab al-Mandab, and near Yemeni regional waters,” Abdul-Malik al-Houthi, leader of the Iran-backed group, said. The Houthis have launched several missile and drone attacks against Israel since October 7, when Hamas fighters from the besieged Gaza Strip carried out an attack on southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people, according to Israeli authorities. The war in Yemen has reached an uneasy stalemate, with fighting at a standstill even as both sides failed to renew a United Natiions-backed truce that expired in October.

# GT Voice: Path of pragmatism UK’s only road to economic improvement

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1301833.shtml
<blockquote>
It is no secret that Cameron once heralded a "golden era" in relations with China in 2015, which was a bright aspect of his foreign policy when he was prime minister back then. Apparently, strengthening economic and trade connections with the Asia-Pacific region, especially with China, will help lift the UK economy out of its difficulties or alleviate its pressure to a certain extent. We're not saying that strengthening ties with the Chinese economy will address all the challenges faced by the UK economy, but doing so can at least exert an important positive impact. The contradiction that Britain faces is that on the one hand, it has the objective need to take a pragmatic approach to promote economic and trade cooperation with China, which is in Britain's interests. In addition to the case of forcing a Chinese company to sell semiconductor facilities to a US company, the UK also removed Chinese companies from the construction of its new Sizewell C power station.

On October 26, Kozhikode also saw the biggest-ever Palestine solidarity march in India, as more than 200,000 people rallied after the regional party, the Indian Union Muslim League, asked them to hit the streets to oppose the war on Gaza. The Indian National Congress, the main opposition party in the southern Indian state, has also announced a solidarity rally on November 23. Seethi said the migration from Kerala to the Gulf beginning in the early 1980s exposed them to the struggles of the Palestinian people, leading to a “natural sympathy” for their cause. Written by journalist and sociopolitical observer Muhammed Kannu, the book, titled Palestine Prashnam (The Palestine Problem), was published 18 years before the formation of Israel and 49 years before Edward Said wrote The Palestine Question in 1979,” M V Bijulal, chairperson of the Centre for West Asian Studies at Mahatma Gandhi University, told Al Jazeera. What we are witnessing in Kerala now is an informed society’s solidarity with the Palestinian cause,” said Bijulal. Advertisement Not a Muslim issue Palestine, however, remains a non-divisive issue in the state, mainly due to an unambiguous stand on it by its prominent political parties – the Indian National Congress, its closest ally the Indian Union Muslim League, and the Communist Party of India (Marxist). All these parties have criticised the federal Hindu nationalist government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), for supporting Israel and abstaining from a recent United Nations vote calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. It is not a Muslim issue at all.” Congress leader VT Balram told Al Jazeera his party has historically denounced Israel’s occupation of Palestine.

# Analysis: Israel’s ‘war on hospitals’ vs Hamas military exaggerations

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/15/analysis-israels-war-on-hospitals-vs-hamas-military-exaggerations
<blockquote>
The past week of Israel’s land incursions into Gaza can be called a “war on hospitals”. Most of Israel’s military activities in the last few days appear directed at or around the medical facilities in Gaza City. Sign up for Al Jazeera Week in the Middle East Catch up on our coverage of the region, all in one place. Most of the Israeli companies appear to have reached their current positions by last Friday and, except for those involved in action around the al-Shifa Hospital, now appear to be waiting for the next stage. They are dug in and encamped in a similar fashion: armed vehicles with their backs to buildings that have obviously been cleared of tenants and occupied by the Israeli army, with as much open area in front of them as possible to deter Hamas incursions. In addition to these three attack columns, satellites show a large group of vehicles inside Israel, close to Nahal Oz, one of the sites of the Hamas attack on October 7. Even in open ground, often using the cover of vegetation and farm buildings, they have taken every opportunity to fire their arsenal at the advancing Israelis. On Saturday, November 11, a spokesman for the Qassam Brigades claimed 160 military vehicles from the two columns that advanced from the north border of Gaza had been destroyed “totally or partially,” including 25 in the 48 hours prior to the announcement. They need a term to denote that something cannot continue to be used and cannot be (easily) repaired, especially not on the spot. Satellite photography does not show many hulks, and the number of Israeli soldiers killed in battle so far, reported to be 48 as of Wednesday morning, suggests the number of truly destroyed vehicles is much lower than Hamas claims.

What is happening at al-Shifa Hospital? Dr Ahmad Mokhallalati, a surgeon at al-Shifa who is currently in the hospital, told Al Jazeera that gunshots can be heard from all directions in the medical facility. Israeli forces have been calling doctors inside al-Shifa. Is there evidence for Israel’s claims? Israel carries the burden to produce evidence and prove that Hamas is using al-Shifa for military purposes, Ardi Imseis, an international law expert at Queen’s University in Canada told Al Jazeera. What has Hamas said? A White House spokesperson for the National Security Council, who did not wish to be named, told the Reuters news agency it does not support attacking a hospital from the air and does not want to see a firefight in a hospital. What has Israel said? While the Israeli military said on Wednesday that its forces have provided incubators and baby food to al-Shifa, the practicality of this is questionable.

# Why is Gaza’s al-Shifa Hospital so important for the Israeli army?

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/15/why-is-gazas-al-shifa-hospital-so-important-for-the-israeli-army
<blockquote>
Ever since the Israeli army’s strikes on the Gaza Strip began after the October 7 Hamas attack, the al-Shifa Hospital in the northern part of the besieged enclave has been prominently featured in the news. The significance of al-Shifa Hospital is beyond the medical. Israel has said it wants to take charge of Gaza’s security in the future. Israel wants to dismantle the hub that al-Shifa has become and take over what it has said it sees as the stronghold of Hamas’s military and administrative capabilities. Nearly a month ago, it was accused of a deadly attack on the al-Ahli Arab Hospital in Gaza, but Israel and the West blamed it on Palestinian fighters firing a faulty rocket from within the Gaza Strip. The Israeli army has spent the past several days gradually tightening its noose around the hospital. This is while thousands of people are still trapped in the hospital. Israel’s main supporting claim for laying siege to the most important hospital in Gaza is that Hamas has a main command centre operating from within and under the hospital. And there has been no clear evidence that a number of the captives taken by Hamas during its October 7 attack are being held within the confines of the hospital.

# US and China agree to resume stalled cooperation on climate crisis

<blockquote>
“The United States and China recognize that the climate crisis has increasingly affected countries around the world,” a joint statement said on Wednesday. Both sides also agreed to include methane in their 2035 climate goals – the first time China has made such a pledge – and committed to advancing “at least five” large-scale cooperation projects in carbon capture, utilisation and storage by the end of the decade. Negotiators from EU member states and the European Parliament agreed on a new law on Wednesday to impose “maximum methane intensity values” and thus limit emissions on the bloc’s oil and gas imports from 2030. Key gas suppliers such as the US and Russia are likely to be most affected by the law when it gets final approval from the European Parliament and EU countries.

# First fuel truck since start of Israel-Hamas war enters Gaza

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/15/first-truck-carrying-fuel-allowed-into-gaza-via-egypt
<blockquote>
However, it is “not at all enough”, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) said, adding that use of the fuel has been “restricted” by Israel. “Just received 23,027 LT [6,083 gallons] of fuel from Egypt (half a tanker) – but its use has been restricted by Israeli authorities – only for transporting aid from Rafah,” Tom White, the director of UNRWA Affairs in the Gaza Strip, said in a post on X. On Tuesday, it gave approval for 24,000 litres (6,340 gallons) of diesel to be allowed into Gaza, but it is meant only for UN trucks and not for Gaza’s hospitals, which are shutting down because they have no fuel to power their generators. Aid agencies in Gaza say a chronic lack of fuel has hampered efforts to deliver food, water and medicine to Palestinians in Gaza, which is under siege as Israel wages a war that has killed at least 11,200 people.

# ‘Hospitals are not battlegrounds’: World reacts to Israel’s al-Shifa raid

After a week of incursions across Gaza in what some are calling a “war on hospitals”, governments, United Nations agencies and other aid organisations expressed their distress on Wednesday as Israel’s military raided al-Shifa, in which thousands of patients, staff and displaced people are trapped. The Palestinian Authority on Wednesday denounced Israel’s operation inside Gaza’s largest hospital.

Although the UN estimated about 2,300 people are inside al-Shifa Hospital, Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum reported on Wednesday that about 7,500 Palestinians, including patients, doctors and displaced people, were sheltering there. “One of the big tanks entered within the hospital from the eastern main gate, and they were, they were, they just parked in the front of the hospital emergency department.” The hospital’s director, Muhammad Abu Salmiya described being unable to communicate with doctors throughout the hospital to inquire about the condition of patients, and said that he was unaware of the state of the premature babies being treated there.

# The scene outside the APEC venue speaks volumes: Global Times editorial

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1301917.shtml
<blockquote>
The 30th APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting is set to officially kick off on November 15, local time. There was also attention on whether the small circles, such as the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) promoted by the US, would lead to fragmentation and impact on APEC cooperation. At the same time, the increasing attention to "geoeconomic fragmentation" reflects a growing strong desire for cooperation and development. As the two largest economies in the world, China and the US together account for over 40 percent of the global GDP. This is a tremendous regret for both China and the US, as well as for the world. It is something that should not be the case. We look forward to the US side meeting the Chinese side halfway, and hope that as the host country of the APEC meetings, the US could cherish and make good use of this opportunity to promote China-US relations to return to a healthy and stable development track, and make the necessary contributions as a major country to the peace, stability, and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region.

If Chinese companies cannot enter the US industry chain in a manner consistent with US rules, then on what grounds can US companies demand more access to the Chinese market? If the US is allowed to define the meaning of bilateral cooperation at will while continuing its high-tech crackdown on China, negative energy between the two sides will increase, which will not serve the interests of either side. But meaningful communication and coordination can only be achieved in a spirit of mutual respect, which is the key to creating favorable conditions for the sound development of bilateral economic and trade relations and the world's economic recovery.

<blockquote>
But I think it will add added pressure on Israel, particularly as the US allowed this resolution to go through – it could’ve used its veto,” said Al Jazeera’s diplomatic editor James Bays. “Out of the previous four resolutions that didn’t go through, probably the one nearest to going through was the one on October 18, that’s when all the countries either voted for, or abstained, and the only country that voted against was the United States – it wielded its veto,” Bays said. What was called for then was a resolution calling for humanitarian pauses,” he added. “It is unfortunate that the council is still unable to condemn or even mention the massacre that Hamas carried out on [October 7] and led to the war in Gaza,” he wrote on X. Over a two-week period last month, four previous resolutions failed in the Security Council, twice when Russia failed to get the minimum votes needed, once when the US vetoed a Brazilian-drafted resolution, and again when Russia and China vetoed a resolution put forward by the US. An initial Brazil-drafted resolution calling for humanitarian pauses was vetoed by the US for failing to “mention Israel’s right of self-defence”.

# Escape from al-Shifa: How a Gaza medic dodged Israeli patrols, snipers

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/16/escape-from-al-shifa-how-a-gaza-medic-dodged-israeli-patrols-snipers
<blockquote>
The 26-year-old doctor’s assistant had managed to leave the besieged al-Shifa Hospital in Gaza City and walk the 16km (10 miles) to Deir el-Balah. “I don’t know where we got the energy to do this work. They were willing to work for three, four days in a row without sleeping, to do anything if they could just save one more child, one more person. Turns out he had been hurt in the Israeli attack on al-Shifa gate the day before, and I hadn’t seen him in the middle of all the injuries that were coming in. If we had the least bit of equipment, maybe we could have helped him, but we had nothing, so we could do nothing. May, 23, was also in Gaza City, but Jawdat was unable to reach her because of tanks, snipers and random explosions on the streets. He knew that there was no way he could have reached her in Gaza City, but the fact that she had only received one of his messages in several days and he had heard nothing from her for three days overwhelmed him. Desperate to be with his family, his mind turned to Deir el-Balah in central Gaza, where he had finally managed to convince his mother to move on Friday. Some of those who died, … all they needed was a little oxygen.” The only respite, he said, was when the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) was able to help them move the premature babies, all bundled up tightly to keep them as warm as possible without their incubators. Jawdat left the hospital with a group of displaced people who had been sheltering at al-Shifa, hoping to make it past Israeli soldiers, tanks and snipers all the way to the south. “They said they were shot at, but they made it south. At one point, Jawdat and a few others were stopped by Israeli soldiers, who made them stand with their hands up in the air, holding their IDs.

# Xi's Footsteps: Xi’s visit to San Francisco injects stability, fosters people exchanges

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1301997.shtml
<blockquote>
In addition to the political aspect of this visit, it is also a reunion among old friends and a way to foster people-to-people exchanges, as the Chinese president pointed out, "the foundation of China-US relations was laid by our peoples." They talked about their excitement in this moment and their hope for the improvement of China-US relations. And as a Chinese student studying in the US, she hopes to serve as a bridge between China and the US and contribute to the people exchanges between the two countries in the future. "I believe this summit between the heads of China and the US also echoes what President Xi has emphasized - the hope for China-US relations is in the people, and the need to continually expand people-to-people exchanges, including societal interactions with American entrepreneurs," Zhu Feng, a professor of international relations at Nanjing University, told the Global Times. "This can largely contribute to the development, prosperity, and stability of the global economy by providing a strong sense of positive energy and certainty, which is extremely crucial," he said. At the Filoli estate on Wednesday, Biden pointed to a photo in his phone with the Golden Gate Bridge in the background. At a welcome dinner by friendly organizations in the US on Wednesday, Xi stressed the role of people in China-US relations. Since that time, the friendships between Xi and Dvorchak's family and other friends in Iowa have continued to flourish. Xi and his old American friends reunited in Iowa after 27 years in 2012 when he visited the US as vice president. Xi was among the first Chinese friends the family got to know. Gary Dvorchak told the Global Times that he felt "very excited and honored" to meet Xi on Wednesday.

"The effectiveness of Security Council resolutions lies in their implementation… It is necessary for the Security Council to establish a necessary mechanism to take follow-up actions to monitor and report on the implementation, Zhang said in an explanation of the vote after the adoption of the Maltese-drafted resolution. Despite this, the resolution is still significant as it constitutes an initial step toward a ceasefire and a minimum requirement to save lives, and helps avert a greater humanitarian crisis and catastrophe, Zhang said.

# Are Israel and Hamas nearing a ‘hostage’ deal? What to know

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/16/are-israel-and-hamas-nearing-a-hostage-deal-what-to-know
<blockquote>
Israel and Hamas are believed to be negotiating a deal to free dozens of people in Hamas captivity in exchange for a three-day ceasefire, according to the Reuters news agency and Axios, a US-based digital publication. Qatari mediation efforts have so far led to the release of four out of around 240 hostages who Israeli officials estimate were taken by Hamas on October 7. But the official involved in the negotiations said that Israel has not agreed to the terms of the deal and is still negotiating the details. He has been under pressure from the families of the captives, who have urged the government to negotiate their release. Izzat El Rashq, a member of the Hamas political bureau, did not directly confirm the deal under discussion when asked by Reuters. Hamas’s armed wing, the Qassam Brigades, said on Monday that it had told Qatari negotiators it was willing to release up to 70 women and children in return for a five-day truce, according to Reuters.

# Pulse on China’s economy: China prepares to front-load policies next year, in bid to guarantee economy gets off to good start: NDRC official

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1301966.shtml
<blockquote>
National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), China's top economic planner, vowed on Thursday that the country will continue its efforts to restore consumer confidence and expand consumption, while accelerating the construction of key projects supported by a special 1 trillion yuan treasury bond ($139.3 billion) issuance, as the world's second-largest economy goes all out to stabilize and boost growth. Half of the amount raised is planned for use this year and the other half for next year, which means that the effects of pro-growth policies will last at least through the first half of 2024, and the economy's inherent growth impetus will be rejuvenated, Wang Qing, chief macroeconomic analyst at Golden Credit Rating International, told the Global Times. Li emphasized that efforts to expand domestic demand will be consistent and include detailed implementation of pro-consumption measures announced previously, along with boosting consumption in key areas and cultivating and tapping into new growth points for consumption. The number of newly registered private enterprises in September increased by 18.1 percent year-on-year, 8.4 percentage points faster than the previous month, official data showed. "Current policies have significantly enhanced support for the private economy and private investment, mainly focused on supporting technological innovation, the real economy and the development of small and medium-sized enterprises," Wang said.

# Put the UN resolution for humanitarian pauses in Gaza into implementation

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1301990.shtml
<blockquote>
The humanitarian pause achieved by this resolution is still far from achieving a crucial cease-fire, as mentioned when Russia abstained from voting. Currently, Israel unilaterally refuses to implement the UN Security Council resolution, calling for the Security Council "to unequivocally condemn Hamas" for its October 7 surprise attack on Israeli communities. This is not surprising based on Israel's firm stance, which has previously rejected the Biden administration's push for temporary pauses in Israeli military action in Gaza. At the UN level, it is time for the US to make adjustments to its policy. Faced with the Security Council's deadlock, if the US continues on a single track, it will only further damage the authority and credibility of the UN Security Council, which is also detrimental to the international image and leadership of the US. Additionally, the support for this issue by the Security Council is related to China's consistent stance on the Palestinian issue over the years.

# Analysis: What’s Israel’s next target after Gaza’s al-Shifa Hospital?

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/17/analysis-whats-israels-next-target-after-gazas-al-shifa
<blockquote>
What to know list 3 of 3 What has Israel ‘found’ in Gaza’s al-Shifa Hospital? One of Israel’s main claims, obviously intended to justify the attacks against Gaza hospital compounds, was that Hamas had nullified the protected status of medical facilities, using them for military purposes, thus giving Israel the right to attack and enter hospitals, all while blaming the Palestinian armed group. The response: “The moment the machine was turned on, it would pull the guns and attach them to itself.” The MRI machine cannot function with rifles on it. But it has failed to uncover – and show – any underground command centres or major tunnels. Failing to produce the underground command centre, late on Thursday, the Israeli army showed a hole in the ground claiming it to be the entrance of a Hamas military tunnel. As the aerial bombardment continues, many observers have failed to notice that apart from the raids on the hospitals, there has been very little movement on the ground for almost a week now. It had put up some resistance to the initial Israeli advance, but kept it limited to opportunistic attacks that were intended more to probe the enemy and show the flag than to really stop the army before it got to the city. But someone in the Israeli army obviously hopes that the sentiment aroused by the symbolic raising of Israeli flags on occupied Palestinian territory – and several more flags were raised among the Gaza rubble on Thursday – might buy them some time before the public starts asking the unpopular question: “Are we beating Hamas?”

Blinken “stressed the urgent need for affirmative steps to de-escalate tensions in the West Bank, including by confronting rising levels of settler extremist violence,” the State Department said in a statement on Thursday. “It’s important to mention that Jabalia refugee camp has seen multiple attacks by Israeli occupation forces and hundreds of civilians have been killed in this camp, which is considered to be the most densely populated inside the Gaza Strip,” Abu Azzoum said. Residents in Jabalia have sought refuge at a United Nations shelter that is close to the Indonesian Hospital, where services have ground to a halt amid Israeli attacks, and staff and patients are running extremely low on food and water.

# Body of Hamas captive Yehudit Weiss found near Gaza hospital, Israel says

<blockquote>
Weiss, a 65-year-old mother of five, was found by Israeli soldiers in a “structure” adjacent to the al-Shifa Hospital, military officials said on Thursday. Israel has claimed that the hospital has been used as a Hamas command centre, and on Thursday released a video showing images of a cache of weapons and a hole in the ground surrounded by rubble. Hamas official Bassem Naim described the claims as a “farce” and said the group did not rule out the possibility that Israeli soldiers had planted the weapons themselves.

# Does Israel have the right to self-defence in Gaza?

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/17/does-israel-have-the-right-to-self-defence-in-gaza
<blockquote>
Israel and its allies, meanwhile, have insisted the bombings are justified because it has the right to self-defence in response to the October 7 Hamas attacks that killed 1,200 people and injured more than 5,600 in southern Israel. But what is this right to self-defence, and does it justify Israel’s killing of more than 11,500 Palestinians and wounding of 29,800 since then? Advertisement Sign up for Al Jazeera Week in the Middle East Catch up on our coverage of the region, all in one place. “Israel does not claim it has been threatened by another state. “The death of a reported 4,710 children, attacks on healthcare, the withholding of water and electricity – these cannot be merely justified as a ‘right to self-defence’,” said Iain Overton, executive director of the London-based Action on Armed Violence, which conducts research and advocacy on armed violence against civilians. Armed conflicts are governed by international humanitarian law (IHL), a set of rules contained in international agreements like the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949 as well as other agreements and conventions meant to ensure that all member nations subscribe to a list of fundamental rules during conflicts. Israel has been accused of war crimes in its previous military assaults on Gaza, but it has not been held accountable. “When Israel claims Hamas targets in refugee camps and hospitals, the idea in both cases is to underscore that the value of the target is extremely high and, therefore, that Israel is abiding by the principle of proportionality even if many civilians die,” Gordon said. Advertisement What about Israeli attacks on hospitals, schools and refugee camps? But what if Hamas is using civilians as ‘human shields’? But many experts believe that painting civilians as human shields is a convenient argument that Israel has used to create legitimacy for its attacks. Others, like Overton, said that even if Israel’s claims about Palestinian civilians being used as human shields are accurate, Israeli actions are still not justified. Israel’s decision to impose a “complete siege” of Gaza’s power, food and water supplies has also been widely criticised for triggering a humanitarian crisis as thousands of Palestinians face “death by starvation”, according to the ActionAid charity. While lawyers and experts have pointed to likely violations by Israel and Hamas of international law and international humanitarian law in particular, that might not ensure legal action against them. Experts point to the lack of action against Israel for its 2008 assault on Gaza, named Operation Cast Lead, during which Israel was accused of war crimes. And not in a hospital,” the UN human rights chief said.

# As Israel bombs Gaza, Ireland’s enduring support of Palestine gets stronger

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/17/as-israel-bombs-gaza-irelands-enduring-support-of-palestine-gets-stronger
<blockquote>
Ireland is once again an outlier in the West, home to some of the loudest criticism of Israel and support of Palestinian rights, as the Middle East conflict rages. In just 41 days of war, more than 11,400 Palestinians have been killed by Israel. After Israel began striking Gaza, Ireland, a member of the European Union, was one of the first countries to call for an “immediate humanitarian ceasefire” to meet the “urgent” needs of civilians. Advertisement Sign up for Al Jazeera Week in the Middle East Catch up on our coverage of the region, all in one place. “I would like the Irish people to continue to use their influence to ensure that there is a ceasefire, an end to the siege and that enough humanitarian aid is getting through,” said Nichillin, who welcomed the news of extra aid. “Ireland’s own history of colonisation by the British has made many Irish people empathetic towards other nations under occupation or colonisation,” said Cathal O’hEanna, a representative of the left-wing nationalist party Sinn Fein. “Our centuries-long struggle for the right to self-determination resonates with the Palestinian struggle for statehood and independence,” he told Al Jazeera. I’d like to see more solidarity with Palestinians and Israelis working together to end the occupation and ensure self-determination for each rather than one side fighting the other.” “Ireland’s relationship with the US is also very good, so I would like to see Ireland use those strengths to play a better diplomatic role [in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict],” said Lyndon. Andrew Cottey, a professor at the University College Cork’s department of government and politics, said that despite the political and public support of Palestine, “whatever the rights or wrongs of recognising Palestine, it would put Ireland in a minority within the European Union” and “significantly at odds with the United States on this issue”. “You can make an argument for recognising Palestine, but were Ireland to do that, would it have any substantive impact on the situation on the ground in Israel and Palestine?

# Dirty secret of Israel’s weapons exports: They’re tested on Palestinians

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/17/israels-weapons-industry-is-the-gaza-war-its-latest-test-lab
<blockquote>
The bomb’s Haifa-based manufacturer, Elbit Systems, has been advertising its qualities on the public relations page of its website since March 2021, when it was integrated into the Israeli military. It’s a claim echoed by Mark Regev, Netanyahu’s former spokesperson, for the country’s overall approach to its war on Gaza, in which, he has said, Israel is “trying to be as surgical as humanly possible”. Yet, more than one month after Israel launched the aerial bombardment of Gaza following a surprise Hamas attack, it has killed at least 11,400 Palestinian civilians, and injured 30,000 in the besieged strip and the occupied West Bank. But by 2014, drones that carry the Spike rocket had already become highly sought-after by other countries. India – Israel’s largest military buyer, which operates more than 100 Israeli-made UAVs – purchased 34 Heron drones in this period, followed by France (24), Brazil (14) and Australia (10), according to a 2014 report by Drone Wars UK. In response, the Israeli government halted all sales of defence and security equipment and associated services to the Latin American country. Colombia is one of an estimated 130 countries that have bought weapons, drones and cyberspying technology from Israel, the world’s 10th-largest weapons exporter. Israel is, by far, the world’s largest exporter of military drones: in 2017, it was estimated that it was behind nearly two-thirds of all UAV exports over the previous three decades. In March 2023, Elbit Systems announced their 120th order for the Hermes 900. A report from Amnesty International in 2019 noted that the whole process by which Israel sells arms is shrouded in secrecy “with no documentation of sales, one cannot know when [these arms] were sold, by which company, how many and so on”. Napalm and other weapons were supplied to El Salvador during its counterinsurgency wars between 1980-1992 that killed more than 75,000 civilians. Despite the Israeli government’s own statement in 2018 declaring it had ceased sales to Myanmar, the Haaretz newspaper reported last year that weapons manufacturers continued supplying the military government until 2022, in violation of the 2017 international arms embargo against the country. “Governments buy and sell to each other directly and through their large defence contractors, but also there is a parallel trade by private firms that is usually not illegal but provides plausible deniability,” Stephen Badsey, professor of conflict studies at Wolverhampton University, said. Two days after the October 7 Hamas attack, Israel’s minister of defence Yoav Gallant compared the Palestinian people with “human animals”. “It is obvious over Israel’s occupation and countless wars that Palestinians are treated as second-class citizens. Like animals,” he said.

# Xi's APEC speech embodies Asia-Pacific region's common expectations for cooperation instead of confrontation

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1302047.shtml
<blockquote>
Chinese President Xi Jinping delivered a written speech to the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) CEO Summit in San Francisco on Thursday (local time), during which he called for staying committed to APEC's "founding mission" that emphasizes openness, inclusiveness, development for all and seeking common ground while shelving differences. He stressed that the Asia-Pacific cannot and should not be an arena for geopolitical rivalry, and still less should it be plunged into a new Cold War or camp-based confrontation. It is also a vivid display of Chinese wisdom that is set to galvanize collaborative efforts, inject more certainty into a world full of rising uncertainties, and transform the Asia-Pacific region - which accounts for over 60 percent of global GDP and nearly half of global trade - into a more dynamic growth engine, analysts said. Noting that the world has entered a new period of turbulence and change, Xi stressed at the speech that we should stay committed to APEC's founding mission, and move to re-launch Asia-Pacific cooperation. Moreover, China's exchanges with other major APEC economies show the country's constructive role in managing differences, which will channel stability to the Asia-Pacific and the entire world," Song said. Attendees of the APEC conference said that Xi's elaboration on the Chinese economic roadmap conveyed China's confidence to the Asia-Pacific and the world, not only lifting entrepreneurial spirits but also galvanizing collaborative efforts for regional cooperation. A report by Asian Development Bank shows that China is expected to contribute 64.2 percent to the Asia-Pacific region's economic growth this year. At an informal dialogue and working lunch during the APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting, Xi said that sustainable development is the "golden key" to solving current global problems. Li from LONGi stressed that China has made great contributions in energy transition in the Asia-Pacific region as well as the world.

# Xi meets Kishida, reaffirming strategic and mutually beneficial relations

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1302045.shtml
<blockquote>
Chinese President Xi Jinping met Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida in San Francisco on the sidelines of the APEC meetings on Thursday afternoon local time, reaffirming the position of comprehensively advancing the strategic and mutually beneficial relations between China and Japan and stressing that the foundation of bilateral relations should not be damaged or shaken, especially when it comes to major questions of principle related to history and Taiwan. Some Chinese and Japanese experts indicated that in recent years, Japan's policy toward China has lost its strategic autonomy, reflecting a trend toward following the US, leading to the continuous accumulation of structural problems between China and Japan. The more this situation persists, the more important it becomes to maintain high-level dialogue, and the latest meeting between the leaders of the two countries has played a significant role in stabilizing overall bilateral relations, they noted. Peaceful coexistence, enduring friendship, mutually beneficial cooperation, and common development are the right direction that serves the fundamental interests of the Chinese and Japanese peoples, Xi told Kishida. Xiang explained that the core of the spirit of the four political documents between China and Japan is, first, for Japan to properly handle major sensitive issues such as history and the Taiwan question, and second, for China and Japan to adhere to the relationship positioning of "mutual cooperation partners, not posing threats to each other." Kamo Tomoki, a professor from the Faculty of Policy Management at Keio University, told the Global Times that the strategic approach of the US toward China has not fundamentally changed, and Japan is likely to follow suit. The significance and impact of the bilateral meetings during the APEC summit are markedly different for China-US relations and China-Japan relations. This requires Japan to actively adapt to changes in the situation, timely adjust its self-perception and its strategic orientation toward China.

# Chinese commerce minister urges to discuss boundary of national security in ‘productive talks’ with Raimondo

However, the observers also said challenges persist in China-US economic and trade ties, as the US is unlikely to ease its containment of China's high-tech sector, urging more trust and exchanges to stabilize bilateral ties. As the two most important economies in APEC, China and the US use the platform to push for reaching consensus, which has a positive significance in helping maintain opening-up within the Asia-Pacific region, Zhou Mi, a senior research fellow with the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, told the Global Times on Friday. The meeting between Wang and Raimondo is one of the immediate signs of progress made after the Xi-Biden meeting, during which the two sides reached more than 20 agreements. The US on Thursday removed the Chinese Ministry of Public Security's Institute of Forensic Science (IFS) from a trade sanctions list, in a bid to move forward with counternarcotics cooperation with China. The White House said on Thursday the US would welcome back any giant pandas China decides to send. Despite the positive progress made through the summit of the two countries' leaders and a series of high-level exchanges, experts said challenges persist for China-US economic and trade relations, as the US' foreign policy of "decoupling" from and cracking down on China is fundamentally unchanged.

# If Japan can keep its word and stick to principles, China-Japan relationship will not deviate

<blockquote>
This year marks the 45th anniversary of the signing of the China-Japan Treaty of Peace and Friendship, which established the foundation of peace, friendship, and cooperation between the two countries. This meeting serves as a significant juncture in the bilateral relationship. In the past year, China-Japan ties have been overshadowed by the influence of China-US relations. Japan has also been compliant in cooperating with the US on high-tech export controls on China and has shown a proactive attitude toward introducing external military forces like NATO into the Asia-Pacific. During the meeting, the two leaders reiterated their commitment to the principles and consensus stipulated in the four political documents between the two countries, reaffirmed the position of comprehensively advancing a mutually beneficial relationship based on common strategic interests, and agreed to dedicate themselves to jointly building a constructive and stable China-Japan relationship that meets the demands of the new era. As long as it is beneficial to both countries and their peoples, we support it. President Xi, when stressing major questions of principle related to history and Taiwan, urged Japan to "keep its word and stick to principles." This is not only in the long-term interests of both China and Japan, but also crucial for Japan's national reputation.

# Argentina’s economy foundering on eve of general election

https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/11/17/argentinas-economy-foundering-on-eve-of-general-election
<blockquote>
Last month’s result surprised many political pollsters, given that Massa is presiding over an economy with an inflation rate of 142.7 percent, coupled with simmering frustrations about Argentina’s Peronist establishment. Today, Peronism represents a patchwork of economic programs, including state-led industrial policy and subsidies for basic goods. “Massa is aware he’ll have to implement austerity measures … He’s now talking about a budget surplus of 1 percent of GDP next year,” said Bortz. Milei, meanwhile, has pledged to slash government spending by a whopping 15 percent of GDP. He has also hinted at privatising state companies and scaling back public health expenditure. This, in turn, has undermined the government’s ability to repay its debt. Still, they’ll be much tamer if Massa wins,” Bortz added. For voters like Malena Pesce, a teacher working in San Isidro, a suburb of Argentina’s capital, inflation and cost of living are big issues going into the upcoming election. “Prices are so high it affects how much food I can buy. Inflation is not new in Argentina, averaging 50 percent from 2018 to 2022. On this point, Milei has said that “eliminating the central bank is essential”. “Milei’s plan to remove the central bank is high-risk and would ensure the loss of monetary authority in Argentina,” Matias Vernengo, a former BCRA official, told Al Jazeera. To carry out his plan, the self-described “anarcho-capitalist” has floated the idea of ditching the peso, which he has described as being worth less than “excrement”, and dollarising – adopting the greenback as Argentina’s sole legal tender. If the US Federal Reserve were to lower rates next year, it would certainly help,” said Vernengo.

However, Khalil Jahshan, executive director of the Arab Center Washington DC, a think tank, said that, so long as the US does not call for a ceasefire, talking about what happens after the war is a “waste of time”. He added that Palestinians should have one authority in the West Bank and Gaza — but after a ceasefire and a democratic election. “But to bring a dysfunctional Authority in the West Bank basically to a total pile of rubble in Gaza, it’s a formula for disaster,” Jahshan told Al Jazeera. “Gaza has to be demilitarised and Gaza has to be de-radicalised,” he told NBC News last week. Khalil also suggested that the US is not serious about resolving the conflict. Israeli forces have also failed to free the captives taken during Hamas’s October 7 attack, and they have not killed senior political or military leaders from the Palestinian group.

But for some analysts, the PA’s shortcomings in the West Bank and its increasingly ageing and isolated leadership make it a non-starter to lead the Palestinian national movement.

# Erdogan in tense talks in Germany as divisions over Gaza war deepen

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/17/turkish-president-erdogan-visits-germany-amid-divisions-over-gaza-war
<blockquote>
“Our solidarity with Israel is not up for discussion,” he said at a joint news conference with Erdogan. The Turkish leader also lashed out at Israel over its relentless air and ground offensive in Gaza, saying that attacks on children and hospitals had no place in the Jewish holy book. Before the visit, the Turkish leader stepped up his condemnation of the Israeli assault on the besieged Gaza Strip, saying it had “unlimited support” from the West. He had previously called for Israeli leaders to be tried for war crimes at the International Court of Justice in The Hague and repeated his view – and Turkey’s longstanding position – that Hamas is not a “terrorist organisation” but a political party that won the last Palestinian legislative elections held in 2006. “I would like to emphasise there are five million Muslims living in Germany and they have a place here,” he added. The two countries have always been, as characterised by Scholz’s spokesman, “uncomfortable partners”. Erdogan linked continuing discussions on that deal, which some European countries would like to revive and amend, to Turkey’s EU accession process, which was been on ice.

# More than 20 patients die at Gaza’s al-Shifa Hospital amid Israeli raid

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/17/more-than-20-patients-die-at-gazas-al-shifa-hospital-amid-israeli-raid
<blockquote>
More than 20 patients have died at Gaza’s al-Shifa Hospital in the last two days as Israeli forces continue to raid the facility, according to a hospital official and the Palestinian health ministry in Gaza. The health ministry said on Friday that 24 patients died over the past 48 hours due to power cuts at the hospital, which has been out of service since Saturday amid a fuel shortage. “We are left with nothing – no power, no food, no water. Israel has said it has agreed to a US request to allow two fuel trucks a day into Gaza, following a UN warning that the shortages had halted aid deliveries and put people at risk of starvation. The UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) said earlier that its aid trucks were unable to enter Gaza from Egypt for a second straight day on Friday due to the lack of fuel and a near-total communications blackout that began on Thursday.

# White House slams Elon Musk’s ‘abhorrent’ promotion of anti-Semitism

Speaking to reporters on Friday, White House spokesman Andrew Bates criticised Musk for calling an anti-Jewish tweet, which accused Jews of undermining Western civilisation through support for immigration, “the actual truth”. The conspiracy theory that Jews are responsible for facilitating this “replacement” through support for immigration and resettling refugees is the same belief that motivated a far-right gunman who stormed a synagogue in the city of Pittsburgh and killed 11 worshipers. On Thursday, the X owner liked a post from a popular account stating that Musk had come under attack for having “the audacity to criticize progressive Jewish organizations for their anti-white policies” by critics who ignore “actual anti-Semitic politicians and groups”.

# Australia could be India’s ‘banana skin’ in Cricket World Cup final

https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2023/11/18/australia-india-icc-cricket-world-cup-final-2023-jason-gillespie
<blockquote>
Australia legend Jason Gillespie has backed his fellow countrymen to pull off one of the great Cricket World Cup final performances against an India side that are “ripe for the picking” on Sunday in Ahmedabad. “We are playing against a powerhouse – the juggernaut that is India, who have all the expectation and all the pressure on them. “And don’t be shocked – you heard it from me – don’t be shocked if Australia just pull off one of the great World Cup final performances and come away with that ring and that World Cup.” Australia headed to the World Cup on the back of a 3-2 one-day international series defeat in South Africa, in which they had taken a 2-0 lead. The closest that India have come to a slip-up in this World Cup was in their opening match against Australia. What Australia have in their advantage is that all the pressure is on India. “What Australia do have in the bank is experience – they have won the World Cup many times, and India will be very, very wary of that.” So what is it about the small nation of 25 million people that has seen them lift five World Cups to India, a country of 1.5 billion, who have two titles to their name? “It’s clear minds, it’s energy, it’s belief and confidence that comes from evidence, doesn’t it?” Gillespie surmised. I’m really excited for this World Cup final – I think it’s going to be an absolute humdinger.

# ‘A lot of discontent’: Netanyahu alone as Israel turns on wartime PM

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/18/a-lot-of-discontent-netanyahu-alone-as-israel-turns-on-wartime-pm
<blockquote>
A poll from November 14 has Netanyahu’s popularity among Israeli Jews at about 4 percent and both his opponents and traditional allies are calling for him to resign once the current war ends. “I suspect there’s a lot of discontent with his leadership of the government, even within his own party,” Zachary Lockman, an expert on Palestine and Israel at New York University, told Al Jazeera. Much of the criticism directed at Netanyahu has been on his seeming lack of interest in freeing the more than 200 captives held in Gaza by Hamas and other armed groups. But Netanyahu has so far refused a larger deal for a temporary ceasefire in exchange for the release of more captives. He said he was frustrated at the lack of support from Netanyahu’s government. Gantz is also a member of Netanyahu’s war cabinet and criticised the prime minister after October 7, when he blamed Israel’s intelligence services and military for the Hamas attack. Gantz is also “free of some of the many burdens that Netanyahu carries,” such as the corruption cases that the prime minister faces. “It is interesting that people are starting to demand for him to step down now as opposed to after the war,” Elgindy said. “The war is not going to end with the great victory that Israelis have been led to believe,” Lockman said. I don’t see how he survives this politically,” Elgindy said.

# India vs Australia: ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 final preview

https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2023/11/18/india-vs-australia-icc-cricket-world-cup-2023-final-preview
<blockquote>
India have long been the heavy favourites for the tournament and, with a perfect 10 so far in this edition, nothing has changed in advance of their showdown with Australia in Ahmedabad. The 130,000-capacity Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad is the biggest cricket ground in the world. Aside from that win, India have underwhelmed at the World Cup ever since their 2003 defeat in the final to Australia. What lies in store for Australia is quite clear and captain Pat Cummins, says his team must “embrace” the challenge of facing their opponents, the enormous crowd in Ahmedabad Stadium and the will of 1.5 billion people. “On this scale, it’s probably bigger than we would have experienced before, but it’s not something totally foreign. The hosts have won all 10 games to this stage, including their opening match against Australia in which they recovered from the loss of three early wickets with only two runs on the board to chase down 200. India are a perfect 10 at the tournament so far – but will the final be their “banana skin”? Without the allrounder to balance the side, India have no choice but to stick with the three seamers that have served them so well since Pandya limped out of the third match of the tournament.

A total of 11 bakeries in the Gaza Strip have been completely destroyed, while others are unable to operate because of the lack of flour, fuel and electricity.

Chinese President Xi Jinping put forward proposals for the Asia Pacific region to usher in another "golden 30 years," calling on Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) members to commit to innovation, openness, green and inclusive development in promoting regional cooperation, as APEC's Economic Leaders' Meeting concluded in San Francisco on Friday. It is also necessary to stay committed to green development, said the Chinese president. Noting that China will remain committed to the path of peaceful development, Xi said that Chinese modernization will bring the world more and greater opportunities for the modernization of all countries, and that he is ready to work with other APEC leaders for new success in Asia-Pacific cooperation and for another "golden 30 years" of the region. According to the 2023 APEC Leaders' Golden Gate Declaration, China and the US as well as more than a dozen of economies in the region, have reaffirmed their determination to "deliver a free, fair, non-discriminatory, transparent, inclusive, and predictable trade and investment environment," and the importance of "the rules-based multilateral trading system, with the WTO at its core." Matta noted that it is logical that everyone is very attentive to whatever the meeting between the leaders of the US and China within the framework of the APEC forum. In other words, there is no real and definitive development of the Asia Pacific area without China, at the same time that China has a fundamental key to its own development in this region of the world.

It added that the administration “is working closely with partners to ensure that life-saving assistance – including, food, water, and medicine can urgently reach innocent Palestinians in Gaza” and emphasised that “the United States stands unequivocally for the protection of civilians during conflict”. There must be no forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, no reoccupation, no siege or blockade, and no reduction in territory,” he wrote, adding that “after this war is over, the voices of Palestinian people and their aspirations” must be at the centre of “post-crisis governance in Gaza”.

# Diseases spread in Gaza amid water and sewage crisis, cholera feared

<blockquote>
“Even if I find it, the problem remains, the water is polluted and salty water, not suitable for drinking,” he said. Brennan said overcrowding, lack of solid waste management, poor sanitation and open-air defecation were all contributing to the spread of diseases including diarrhoea, respiratory infections and skin infections, including scabies. The halt of key services including water desalination plants, sewage treatment and hospitals has led to a 40 percent increase in diarrhoea for people taking shelter in UNRWA schools, the agency said. It estimated that about 70 percent of Gaza’s 2.3 million people – more than half of whom are children – no longer have access to clean water. The Ministry of Health in Gaza has warned that the lack of clean water caused by fuel shortages has put the lives of 1,100 patients with kidney failure, including 38 children, particularly at risk. “When he is in great pain, he screams,” Abdeen, 40, told Al Jazeera as he searched the streets of Khan Younis for bottled water to buy. Asaad said his family prefers to line up for hours to fill bottles at filling stations, but they are under no illusion that the water there will be any safer to drink. “I am forced to drink seawater and people here also do that,” she told Al Jazeera. “Is this a punishment for the children, who ask every day when the war will end?

Russia has launched several waves of drone attacks on the Kyiv, Poltava and Cherkasy regions of Ukraine, stepping up its assaults on the Ukrainian capital after several weeks of respite, according to Ukrainian officials. Russia began carrying out strikes on Ukraine’s energy, military and transport infrastructure in October 2022, six months after Moscow’s troops failed to take over the capital and withdrew to Ukraine’s east and south. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other officials have warned that Russia will resume its large-scale bombardment of Ukrainian civilian infrastructure during the winter months.

# Alexander, Alexandria, and a tribute to a great Egyptian city

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/19/alexander-alexandria-and-a-tribute-to-a-great-egyptian-city
<blockquote>
Alexandria: The City that Changed the World, by Egyptian-British academic Islam Issa, himself one of the 100th generation of Alexandrians, is the biography of what is now Egypt’s second city. But while the man named numerous cities after himself (Kandahar in Afghanistan and Khujand in Tajikistan were originally named in his honour), today, there is only one Alexandria. The growth of the city on the back of its founding by Alexander and the rule of the Ptolemaic dynasty (305-30 BC) that followed led to a rapid influx of people from around the ancient Mediterranean world, attracted to what the author calls the “Alexandrian Dream”, a place of wide avenues, copious marble and giant parks, where the Pharos Lighthouse, an ancient wonder of the world, served as an ancient Statue of Liberty. The queen, whose racial identity has now led to a controversy that Issa addresses in the book, was as cosmopolitan as Alexandria itself, speaking 11 languages. The strife has contributed to the city’s identity, but so does its history. But they are also Alexandrian. The city is not as cosmopolitan as it once was, or as Alexander himself would have once envisioned. The Greeks and other communities may be gone, but Issa points out that it does not mean the city’s culture is a monolith. Issa ends the book by describing one of his own trips to Alexandria, arriving from the sea, and how the history of the city still lives on, in both his imagination and the scene that sits before him. Whatever the future does bring, it will be hard to tell its story in a more informed and affectionate way than Issa has. His history is a tribute to Alexandria, a reservoir of knowledge on the city, and sets a marker for those wishing to tell the stories of the world’s great cities.

# Concertgoers sue organizer over obstructed view at Malaysian singer’s Shanghai concert

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1302095.shtml
<blockquote>
Nine concertgoers have filed a lawsuit against the organizer of Malaysian singer Fish Leong's Shanghai concert in May, alleging that their views were obstructed by pillars without being informed in advance and seeking for a full refund of their tickets and damages. They argued that the organizer had failed to inform them in advance about serious visual obstructions, accusing the defendant of fraudulent behavior and infringement of consumer rights. During the trial, the plaintiffs' representatives said that the key issue was whether the defendants had informed all attendees in advance about potential obstructions to their view. Other four plaintiffs said that they attempted to voice their concerns but were prevented by security and failed to find staff members. In the closing statements, the defense argued that the plaintiffs were aware of the extent of the visual obstruction when they chose their seats but stayed for the entire concert, indicating their acceptance of the provided service, the contract was fulfilled, and there was no basis for further refunds. Zhang Yuxia, a public interest lawyer from the Shanghai Consumer Rights Protection Committee and head lawyer for the plaintiffs, expressed the hope that the case would provide guidance on the responsibility of concert organizers in such situations and contribute to the regulation of the industry, according to the report.

# Apple’s Chinese manufacturer reportedly shifts investment from India to Vietnam; experts say it may affect Apple’s supply chain

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1302103.shtml
<blockquote>
Luxshare, one of Apple's largest Chinese component and finished product makers, is shifting its new investment of $330 million to Vietnam from India, where it failed to expand its business, according to media reports. Chinese experts said that the shift indicates the rising protectionism of the Indian market against foreign investors, particularly those from China, which will affect the supply chain integrity of Apple in India and shatter the confidence of other investors in the South Asian market. After several failed attempts to expand its operations in India for nearly three years, Luxshare decided to shift a new investment of $330 million to Bac Giang in Vietnam, Indian media outlet Business Standard reported on Thursday. This raises its total investment in Vietnam to $504 million, the report said. The deteriorating business environment for Chinese companies in India has been marked by ongoing inspections, investigations, restrictions on personnel and visa denials - as seen in Chinese automaker BYD's Indian electric vehicle assembly plant with no personnel from China.

# GT Voice: Western games should not diminish Africa cooperation

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1302104.shtml
<blockquote>
As a result of Western anxiety about growing China-Africa cooperation, Africa has risen from the "forgotten continent" to become a hot investment for the developed Western countries, with the continent's economic value and geopolitical significance being "rediscovered." With China-Africa cooperation flourishing in the fast-growing continent, it is not hard to see that Western public opinion now regards Africa as a key region in their race with China for geopolitical influence and economic opportunities. Chinese companies have signed more than $700 billion worth of infrastructure and engineering contracts in Africa, with turnover exceeding $400 billion. Actually, there is no need for us to be concerned whether the West will step up competition or not. If China-Africa cooperation can bring a sense of urgency to the West or stimulate the Western countries to increase investment in the continent, it will be a welcome development for African countries, and a testament to the positive effects of China's Belt and Road Initiative.

# UK bids farewell to its only pair of giant pandas

Panda lovers in the UK are rushing to say goodbye to the only giant pandas in the country as preparations has been made for them to return to China after the end of their 10 year loan. Yang Guang and Tian Tian, also known as Sunshine and Sweetie, came to Scotland in December 2011 under a 10-year deal between the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland (RZSS) and the China Wildlife Conservation Association.

While answering the question as to why the pandas are returning to China, the RZSS said they plan to convert the giant panda habitat at the zoo to welcome a new species in the future. When some individual media outlets are defaming China by saying it is taking advantage of giant pandas in response to current diplomatic relations, why haven't they considered it may be that the UK did not seek an extension?

# US’ domestic politics the biggest source of uncertainty for future China-US relations

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1302107.shtml
<blockquote>
Standing at this new point is the result of joint efforts from both sides. However, since then, the US has not only stopped its efforts to contain China, instead, it has intensified it, to the extent that China-US relations have once again reached a dangerous point of being out of control. Another uncertainty is next year's US election. If a new president takes office, will he continue the China policy established by Biden? It may not be difficult for Washington to formulate and promote a policy that views China as a competitor, but it is very difficult to draw a line during the promotion process, to know where to stop and to promote cooperation based on such a broad goal. This is why, since Trump initiated the trade war against China, the US government has often said it will but the fact is that it has failed to do so. We cannot help but admire the ability of American scholars to come up with new and innovative ideas, but this new concept cannot hide the contradictions and conflicts between competition and coexistence.

# Xi’s trip adds stability to China-US ties, injects positivity to intl landscape

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1302130.shtml
<blockquote>
Chinese President Xi Jinping on Saturday evening returned to Beijing after holding a China-US summit meeting and attending the 30th APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in San Francisco, with expectations from experts from both China and the US that the trip will serve to further stabilize the most important bilateral ties in the world, while they also cautioned about the possible uncertainties from the US side. Chinese analysts said on Sunday that now China has pointed out the correct direction for how to develop the China-US relations, it is time to see how much the US can do and to what extent the uncertainties in Washington will impact the future. During the APEC meeting, the world has also seen China's confidence and openness to contribute to the global economic recovery, so that the world, which faces uncertainties and even turbulence in some regions, can share more benefits brought by the Chinese market with the highest certainty, experts noted. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Saturday briefed the media on President Xi's talks with US President Joe Biden and his attendance at the APEC meeting in San Francisco, the Xinhua News Agency reported. Jin Canrong, associate dean of the School of International Studies at the Renmin University of China, told the Global Times on Sunday that there is a clear difference between the two countries which was on display at both the summit in Bali in 2022 and in San Francisco this time. "China hopes the summit can set the tone for bilateral ties from a strategic, overarching and directional perspective," he said, adding that the US has given its answer about competition and it only hopes a crisis can be managed after it breaks out. Lü Xiang, a US studies expert and research fellow from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told the Global Times that "By outlining the 'five pillars,' President Xi told the US side how to correctly develop bilateral ties, and this is the guideline that is able to not only ensure peaceful coexistence but also make win-win cooperation serve the most fundamental interests of the two peoples. "China and the US still think differently, as China wants to fundamentally rule out the possibility of crisis by asking the US to change its policy of containing China, while the US cares more about how to manage the situation after a crisis breaks out as it wants to remain its containment against China," he noted. "It proves that groups who don't want to see China-US ties stabilizing will not disappear after the summit, and that the US mainstream media, as always, will misinterpret the significance of the summit and the necessity for both sides to manage their differences.

# Hope for long-term Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal remote, as divergences remain large: experts

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1302116.shtml
<blockquote>
Photo: VCG People are seen among the rubble of buildings destroyed in an Israeli airstrike in the southern Gaza Strip city of Rafah, on Nov. 15, 2023. The possibility of a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel has been brought to spotlight after a US media claimed that the two sides are close to agreement on a US-brokered deal to pause conflict and release hostages, which was later denied by the White House. However, the hope for long-term pause is still remote because divergences between the two remain large and Israel is in a bind of both international and domestic pressure. For both Hamas and Israel, the need to reach a ceasefire deal is more pressing as the conflict is dragging on without an obvious winner, Liu Zhongmin, a professor at the Middle East Studies Institute of Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Sunday. Netanyahu on Saturday admitted that there was heavy international pressure against Israel's war on Hamas, as he pledged to continue pressing Hamas in Gaza until the latter is overthrown and the hostages it seized are returned, Times of Israel reported. The tour will be the first step in carrying out decisions reached at a joint Arab and Islamic summit held in Riyadh this month, Saudi Foreign Minister Prince Faisal bin Farhan said on the sidelines of a conference in Bahrain in comments posted by his ministry on the social media platform X on Saturday. "We have to work on ending this crisis and the war on Gaza as soon as possible," Reuters reported. Choosing China as the first stop revealed those countries' trust in China on conciliating the ongoing conflicts between Palestine and Israel, said Zhu.

# Hope the US gesture of cooperation can be reliable: Global Times editorial

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1302135.shtml
<blockquote>
It was the US that strongly demanded the Russian-Ukrainian conflict be included in the Bangkok Declaration, which caused a great deal of controversy at the time, because most of the members believe that APEC is a mechanism for economic cooperation, not a forum for discussing geopolitical issues. The US obviously didn't not want to mess up the APEC summit, as it is not only about the sense of shame, but it's also related to US' soft power, national credibility, and "leadership" that the US particularly cares about. We see that the US played some little tricks as the host of the APEC summit, such as organizing the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (IPEF) Meetings in San Francisco. It's clear that any multilateral economic and trade mechanism in the Asia-Pacific region that excludes China won't go far. The results must be different whether we choose to go along with these expectations or be contrary to them. For example, the APEC summit in San Francisco, to a certain extent, improved the atmosphere of the international arena and increased the confidence of the regional members in the prospects for cooperation, which is already a considerable achievement.

That was because of the afternoon pitch. “India struggled to hit boundaries in the afternoon, and it was a lot easier for Australia to hit boundaries because the ball was coming onto the bat.” If there was one criticism of the performance for Shastri, it was that India could have attacked more when Australia lost early wickets.

# China-Middle East summit told ‘Israel seeks to end Palestinians’ presence’

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/20/israel-seeks-to-end-palestinians-presence-on-their-land-pa-minister
<blockquote>
Beijing is hosting a delegation of foreign ministers from the Palestinian Authority, Indonesia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Jordan for talks aimed at finding a solution to end the war in the Gaza Strip. The summit, during which China pledged to work to “restore peace in the Middle East,” is seen as part of a push by Beijing to step up its international role. Beijing’s Middle East envoy Zhai Jun visited the region last month seeking a solution to end the war and has been in talks with Russia to work together to help Israel and Palestine reach a two-state solution. The meetings are a sign that China is stepping up its international role by filling a power vacuum left by the US, according to political analyst Ibrahim Fraihat.

# Qatar-UN mediation returns orphaned Ukrainian teen home after Russia ordeal

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/20/qatar-un-mediation-returns-orphaned-ukrainian-teen-home-after-russia-ordeal
<blockquote>
An orphaned Ukrainian teenager, who was taken to Russia from occupied regions of the war-torn country, has returned home ahead of his 18th birthday after mediation from the UN and Qatar, avoiding potential conscription in the Russian army. The teenager, who had been living in the port city of Mariupol with his cousin after both his parents died, was captured by Russian troops in the first weeks of Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and put into a foster home in Russia. Yemokhin tried to return home on his own through Belarus earlier this year but was stopped at the border and sent back. Lvova-Belova, Russia’s children’s commissioner, said Yermokhin left Russia on Saturday on a plane to Minsk, where he met a cousin, before continuing to Ukraine. Ukraine’s human rights ombudsman Dmytro Lubinets said he was grateful Yermokhin was back home after his long ordeal.

# Fans slam ‘mostly silent’ crowd at India-Australia World Cup title clash

https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2023/11/20/icc-cricket-world-cup-2023-final-fans-slam-mostly-silent-crowd-at-india-australia-title-clash
<blockquote>
But as the Indian players stumbled and stared at defeat, thousands of fans in the 100,000-plus-capacity stadium began to leave their seats before the game ended – a sorry image after India’s flawless route to the final. After all, this was a World Cup final, the biggest match in world cricket and it was happening on our home soil. Annujj Palaye, a communications professional for a top-tier Indian football team, said seeing Indian fans leave early was “understandable”, but he said he was more disappointed by the crowd’s failure to cheer India during their tough moments. Rohit did his job but Gill got out soon, so that put pressure on Kohli and KL Rahul to get a steady start. Australia didn’t have a perfect tournament but they had a run which peaked at the right time,” she said. Sunday’s final was a repeat of the 2003 World Cup, when Australia beat India by 125 runs in the final after the then-Australian captain Ricky Ponting’s 140 runs helped the team post an impressive score of 360. Palaye, who had watched the 2003 final on TV, said the game was similar to this year’s summit clash. Indian captain Rohit Sharma, 36, and the ace hitter Virat Kohli, 35, looked teary-eyed as their excellent campaign ended on a dull note – Kohli, player of the tournament, scored a record 765 runs with an average of 96 runs, while Sharma was the second-highest with 597 runs. “I know that Rohit may not get a chance to play at the World Cup again, but it won’t be a blemish on his career.” “It is unlikely that a 39-year-old would play at a World Cup, but if there is anyone who could play at 39, it would be Kohli,” she said. Australia were the better team from the toss to the final ball – you just have to admit it.”

He alleges that the deception was conducted by fellow Canadian prisoner Michael Kovrig, and it was intelligence work by the latter that led to both men's incarceration by Chinese authorities, according to the Globe and Mail. He is also alleging, the sources say, that a senior diplomat in Beijing had conversations with Kovrig about his relationship with Spavor after Kovrig took a leave of absence from Global Affairs Canada in 2017 to join the International Crisis Group (ICG), an independent, non-governmental global think tank. The source said Kovrig was not an employee of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service but that information he gathered in China was viewed as valuable by the spy agency.

# GT Voice: Why is China confident of meeting its carbon pledge?

China is making every effort to integrate its pursuit of carbon goals further into its economic development amid Western questions about whether the country will meet its 2030 carbon pledge. They have not only underestimated the determination and efforts of the Chinese government to achieve its emission reduction targets, but also showed ignorance of the economic logic behind China's green development drive. This is because energy conservation and emission reduction have been fully integrated into China's economic development agenda.

# Analysis: Can the US and Israel stop the Houthis from seizing more ships?

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/20/analysis-can-the-us-and-israel-stop-the-houthis-from-seizing-more-ships
<blockquote>
Many of them have a legal status like the Galaxy Leader, which flies the flag of the Bahamas, is operated by a Japanese company, and had a Bulgarian master and a crew from at least five other countries, none of them Israel. In the complex world of shipping, the ownership of a ship is less important than the flag of the vessel, which signifies its country of registration, and its operating company. Among almost 1,500 ships transiting the straits every month, there may be scores that could be linked to Israel and that are thus vulnerable to further Houthi hijackings. But Saudi Arabia is in an uneasy truce with the Houthis, which they are loathe to disturb. The only force left to deal with the Houthi threat would be the United States navy. Since October 7, the US has deployed many assets to the Middle East, centred around two carrier strike groups (CSGs).The one in the Mediterranean, the CSG 12, is led by the newest and most modern nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, the USS Gerald R Ford. Iran’s supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, has made it clear that his country would continue to support Hamas and the Palestinian people but it does not want to go to war itself. The only ships that can be used to escort commercial shipping are those grouped around the amphibious carrier USS Bataan, currently just south of Suez. Another hijacking could have a snowball effect, pulling in other countries more actively into an already devastating conflict and pushing it to the point of no return.

# China, Uruguay eye deepening ties as Lacalle starts China visit

<blockquote>
The flags of China and the Oriental Republic of Uruguay hang at Tian'anmen Square in Beijing on November 20, 2023, welcoming the state visit of Uruguayan President Luis Alberto Lacalle Pou. Taking place in a year that marks the 35th anniversary of the establishment of relations between the Latin American country and China, Lacalle Pou's trip is significant in further bolstering ties with its paramount trading partner, with discussions likely covering negotiation of a free trade agreement, consolidating trade of goods such as milk and dairy products, and expanding cooperation in the domains including green and digital development high on agenda, Chinese observers said. This will be President Lacalle Pou's first visit to China. It is reasonable to expect that President Lacalle Pou would increase the trade volume of such products and hope to expand that during the state visit. Uruguayan Minister of Livestock, Agriculture, and Fisheries, Fernando Mattos, who is set to accompany President Lacalle on the visit to China, expressed in a recent exclusive interview with the Xinhua News Agency that Uruguay hopes to deepen cooperation with China in the fields of agriculture and livestock, aspiring to become a "trusted and reliable food supplier" for China. He was elected Uruguay's president in November 2019, and sworn in on March 1, 2020. Chinese analysts said such remarks laid bare Washington's hegemonic approach and malicious intention to compete with China in the Latin America region which it has for a long time treated as its "backyard," and forced regional countries to take sides, which increasingly meets reluctance from the Latin American countries.

De-escalating the ongoing Palestine-Israel conflict and protecting civilians are clearly the tasks that the Arab and Islamic countries, and many other countries including China hope to accomplish in the near future on the Palestinian question, while seeking a just settlement of the Palestinian question is a long-term pursuit due to its complexity. This has led to a great sense of trust from Arab-Islamic countries in China's role in the Middle East issues. Therefore, the US will keep changing its policy over the Palestine-Israel conflict based on its needs and circumstances, noted Liu.

# Russian diplomacy leverages Israel-Hamas war for moral high ground

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/20/russian-diplomacy-leverages-israel-hamas-war-for-moral-high-ground
<blockquote>
But Israel’s prosecution of the war in Gaza is undermining their moral high ground and weakening criminal prosecutions against Russia, international relations and law experts say. Sign up for Al Jazeera Week in the Middle East Catch up on our coverage of the region, all in one place. So it would be very difficult for these states now to argue, ‘Yes, the ICC has jurisdiction over Russians who commit crimes in Ukraine, but no, it does not have jurisdiction over Israelis who commit crimes in Palestine,'” said Marko Milanovic, a professor of public international law at Reading University. For a year, Ukraine has led an international effort to set up a special court that will try Russia for its war of aggression – a crime under the UN Charter. “And now, after Gaza, most of these countries are not going to be willing to play ball… The West has lost whatever moral leverage it had in pushing for this new institution … the more the Gaza [war] goes on and the US supports Israel, the less other states will support this.” “Their goal is to portray themselves as peacemakers, and they can’t be seen as following the US lead,” said Maxim Alyukov, a researcher at Manchester University’s department of Russian and East European studies, who monitors Russian official language and propaganda. “Nobody criticises Israel, and there are double standards here because when it comes to Ukraine, they openly criticise the fact that civilians are dying, but they don’t seem concerned that Palestinians are dying,” said Alyukov, summarising the Russian position.

# What Israel’s video of ‘Hamas tunnel’ under al-Shifa tells us

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/20/what-israels-video-of-hamas-tunnel-under-al-shifa-tells-us
<blockquote>
The Israeli military released a statement on Sunday saying it had found a Hamas tunnel shaft under Gaza’s al-Shifa Hospital. Lasting for days, the raid was described by Israel as a “precise and targeted” operation to find an alleged underground tunnel system that led to a Hamas military control centre. The allegation that Hamas was operating a control centre under the hospital was backed by Israeli and United States intelligence. On Sunday, Israel announced that a 55-metre-long (180ft), 10-metre-deep (32ft) tunnel was found under the hospital. It shows features such as load-bearing concrete columns. Such a construction could not have been done in secret, the way Hamas tunnels are usually built. Was a Hamas control centre found under Gaza’s al-Shifa Hospital? Israeli troops have not yet tried to open the blast door at the end of the tunnel that they claim was under al-Shifa, fearing it could be booby-trapped, said Hagari. Tunnels in Gaza were first built in 1980 at a time when the enclave was under Israeli occupation, and before the formation of Hamas in 1987. The first sign of the military use of tunnels was in 2001 when an Israeli military post was blown up with an explosive from underground. Al-Shifa is not the only hospital that Israel has alleged is used by Hamas as a military base.

# Canada owes an apology to China and others deceived: Global Times editorial

The Canada media outlet the Globe and Mail's recent exposure that two Canadians Michael Spavor and Michael Kovrig are suspected of engaging in spying activities in China has further revealed the truth of the case, which has caused the biggest diplomatic storm in recent years between China and Canada, and has made Canada's intense allegations of China's so-called "arbitrary detention" lose the factual basis and become a huge lie. On the one hand, it insisted that the two men were wrongly accused, smearing China's move as the "retaliation" of Canada detaining Huawei executive Meng Wanzhou, and was unacceptable "arbitrary detention"; on the other hand, it rallied diplomats of several other countries to jointly pressure China and attempted to interfere in the judicial sovereignty of China. More facts now show that if this is a "wrongly accused case," China is the one that has been wrongly accused, and that this is a huge unjust case created by Canadian and Western public opinion against China. According to the Globe and Mail, Spavor blamed Kovrig for their detention in China and alleged that he "unwittingly" provided some of the intelligence to Kovrig, who, "unbeknownst to Mr Spavor," passed the information to "the Canadian government and its Five Eyes spy-service partners." It is reported that Spavor is seeking a multimillion-dollar settlement with the Canadian government, or else he will sue the Canadian government and Kovrig. The Canadian government's hype of this case at the time stirred up a considerable amount of sympathy from the Canadian public toward Kovrig and Spavor, as well as anger towards China.

Also on Monday, China's one-year loan prime rate (LPR), a market-based benchmark lending rate, remained at 3.45 percent, unchanged from the previous month. According to data released by the PBC on November 13, the country's yuan-denominated loans rose by 738.4 billion yuan in October, which far exceeded market forecasts of 600-650 billion yuan. On Friday, the PBC, the National Administration of Financial Regulation and the China Securities Regulatory Commission jointly told the country's biggest financial institutions to balance their loan offerings and coordinate their credit plans for the final two months of this year and the beginning of next year to bolster steady economic growth, according to a statement on the central bank's website. "There is room for a cut to the LPR interest rate, which relies on the performance of the economy, consumer prices, MLF interest rates and other factors," Zhou said, noting that he believes the LPR will remain steady through the end of 2023.

At a special parliamentary session earlier this month, Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong explained that Singapore’s “longstanding support for a two-state solution remains unchanged”, in that Palestinian people have the right to a homeland and that Israel has the right to live within secure borders, he added. At the same time, it is “also possible to support Israel’s right to defend itself and for Israel to avail itself of the use of force to protect its legitimate interests but also demand that Israel’s response must be consistent with the rules and requirements of public international law so that the safety, security and wellbeing of civilians are safeguarded,” he said. “What the debate in parliament demonstrated is that Singaporeans can hold very strong views on the tragedy unfolding in the Middle East region and yet come to a consensus on how Singapore and Singaporeans should respond… In short, Singapore firmly believes that Israelis and Palestinians have the right to live in peace, security and dignity.” Advertisement Sign up for Al Jazeera Week in the Middle East Catch up on our coverage of the region, all in one place.

# As a Muslim prisoner in the US, I worry I will be cremated when I die

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/21/as-a-muslim-prisoner-in-the-us-i-worry-i-will-be-cremated-when-i-die
<blockquote>
On February 8, 2022, about an hour before the 6.30am morning count, an announcement rang out over the loudspeakers at New Jersey State Prison (NJSP). Located in Trenton, NJSP is the state’s only maximum security prison for men. Approximately 400 are Muslim. I work for the prison’s chaplaincy department and know that of the nearly 120 men who reside on 2-Right, more than two dozen of them are from our Islamic congregation, which is among the largest in the US prison system. Because of the heightened atmosphere of fear of death during the pandemic, many Muslims at NJSP had begun to feel intense anxiety about our final rites, and what would happen to our bodies if we died. I first met Mujahid at about the time of my arrival at NJSP in August 2005, three years after I was arrested. I was 28 years old when I arrived, and had known him for the better part of two decades. Mujahid had been in prison for more than 40 years. He was 67 when he died. When Poncho and Samuel, who asked that only his first name be used in this article, came by, I was sitting with Sheikh Jamal El-Chebli, supervisor of NJSP’s chaplaincy department and an employee of the New Jersey Department of Corrections (NJDOC), the government agency responsible for the state prison system. The officer escorting the nurse immediately called for the medical code. Soon, medical staff arrived and pulled Mujahid’s body out of his cell, attempting to resuscitate him for what Poncho called “a good half hour”. During my imprisonment, I have known of Muslim prisoners who have died without a family willing or able to claim their bodies. In such a situation, the only way to override the wishes of the immediate next of kin is to obtain what the state of New Jersey calls a “funeral agent”. We are not given the information we need about the process of securing those rites, nor do we know if there is a proper way for imprisoned Muslims in New Jersey – many serving extremely long sentences – to ensure our burial wishes are carried out. Without the agency as Muslim prisoners to elect our burial preferences, we fear being cremated against our religious beliefs. Mujahid and other Muslim prisoners including myself have tried to petition for and establish a mechanism within NJDOC to ensure Islamic last rites for Muslim prisoners. Without such a mechanism, decisions about what happens to the body after death may fall to an unsympathetic family member or the state. This is the question many Muslim prisoners asked after Mujahid passed away, as we worried whether a family member would claim his body. Their names are Rahim, Alim, and Talib. These men were my brothers, and I wish I could tell you when exactly they died. In the cases of Talib and Abdullah, both had family members who refused to honour their burial preferences. For Alim, his family could not afford burial, according to a fellow prisoner who knew the family. I knew each of these men in some way or another and learned of their cremations through both close acquaintances and past and current prison chaplains. All were members of our congregation. Both Talib and Alim had submitted self-made wills to various prison departments declaring their burial preferences. Some people have even had copies of these documents notarised by notary personnel arranged by the prison and accepted by various prison departments. For many prisoners, these are a last-ditch attempt to secure some clarity on their rites. Death by imprisonment The anxiety about last rites stems largely from the fact that dying in prison in the state of New Jersey will or could be a reality for many prisoners, including myself. At 25 years of age with no prior run-ins with the law, I was given a sentence that would see me imprisoned for 70 years beyond the state’s average life expectancy. I also have a few other relatives and loyal friends who have supported me during my imprisonment. Another possibility is that even if my family is around, there is no guarantee that they will be able to afford my burial costs. “My family ostracised me for converting, and now I’m worried that when I pass away they will either refuse to let me be buried as a Muslim or will refuse to claim my body and I will be burned,” he confided. He had come to submit a self-made will to the chaplaincy department a few weeks after the death and cremation of Alim in 2020. He accepted Mujahid’s body. Many people came to the chapel to speak about him and the support he had provided us all over the years. Nearly one month after Mujahid died, Sheikh El-Chebli relayed to Sheikh Rafique and myself that Mujahid had been buried as a Muslim. When that happens, our brother and our community may not be so fortunate.

# Keeping Gaza online: Telecom heroes risk life and limb under Israel’s bombs

On the first day of its offensive on Gaza on October 7, Israel cut electricity to the territory.

The relentless nature of the conflict is also weighing on staff, who are dogged by danger from their house to the field. I cannot explain to my wife and kids why I do that or why I volunteer to go out during the war. “It is very difficult to call my colleagues who are under bombardment and ask them to go out. PalTel was part of the campaign to keep Gaza connected to telecoms networks this month [PalTel via X] The cables that connect Gaza to the outside world run through Israel, and the country on at least two occasions has deliberately cut off the strip’s international communications.

# Analysis: How Israel could gain from a pause in the Gaza war

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/21/analysis-how-israel-could-gain-from-a-pause-in-the-gaza-war
<blockquote>
Another Hamas official told Al Jazeera that negotiations were centred on the duration of the truce, details of aid delivery to Gaza and the exchange of hostages and prisoners. Where there’s smoke, there’s fire. The Israeli war machine has been going at full strength for six weeks in the air and three weeks on the ground in Gaza. Initially, many analysts believed that the intense aerial attacks served to demonstrate to the Israeli populace that the armed forces were doing something and that bombing would be eased once land forces moved in. There are reliable reports escaping the net of military secrecy that the Israeli Air Force (IAF) is running out of smart bombs. There is little doubt that heavier and less urgent supplies are being shipped to Israel by sea. Israel’s response to initial heavy Hamas rocket attacks and attacks from Hezbollah and the Houthis had depleted Israel’s stocks to such an alarming level that it requested all of the Tamir interceptor missiles that the US had bought and kept in Israel until deployment. The Israeli forces would also welcome a break in fighting to evaluate its tactics so far in light of its performance against Hamas tunnels. While the military would welcome three or five days of respite — but would likely not admit it — politicians would clearly see it as their loss. If the agreed period without fighting is observed, which is always a big risk, Israeli politicians will face new pressure at its end; the world might ask, “If it was a success, why don’t you just extend it?”

Hospital corridors across Bangladesh are filled with dengue patients [Nazmul Islam/Al Jazeera] Public health expert and former DGHS director Dr ANM Nuruzzaman told Al Jazeera this year’s outbreak is no less than an epidemic. “Dengue is a serious crisis as the pattern and severity of the disease have changed and turned to worse. Government officials claim that they have done everything to check dengue’s spread and that declaring it a public emergency or epidemic would not have made much difference. “The problem is our country’s healthcare system has serious limitations because we are a large population and it’s almost impossible to ensure healthcare and treatment for all,” he said. But this year, over 75 percent of patients were diagnosed with Den-2 and almost all the patients who died were affected by this particular strain,” said Amin, adding that multiple studies have found that Den-2 outbreak is worse when it is followed by years of Den-3 prevalence. “This year, the disease has spread across the country, and in rural areas, the health facilities are very scarce. Kabirul Bashar, professor of medical entomology at Bangladesh’s Jahangirnagar University, told Al Jazeera that the pattern of dengue subsiding by September changed last year when the disease reached its peak in October and caused 86 deaths.

# Have the US and Israel agreed on Gaza’s future?

<blockquote>
With $14.3bn in US aid fast-tracking its way to Israel’s military, it seemed the war was not over just yet. Palestinians look at destruction after Israeli attacks on Rafah, Gaza Strip, November 15, 2023 [Hatem Ali/AP Photo] A month into the war, there was a shift in tone. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who said he had seen his “own children” in the images of dead Palestinian kids, appeared to push back on Netanyahu’s assertion that Israel would be responsible for security in the enclave for an “indefinite period” after the war. There would, however, be a “transition” and “mechanisms” for security, said Blinken. Advertisement What about Israel? After Blinken’s speech, Netanyahu appeared to partly acquiesce to the US game plan, saying his country did not intend to “occupy” the strip after the end of the war. But, in an interview with CNN, the Israeli prime minister made it clear he would not be handing over control to the PA. “There has to be a reconstructed civilian authority,” he said of the PA. “There has to be something else.”  At a news conference, he took issue with the PA’s school syllabus, which he claimed fuelled hatred of Israel, and its payments to families of imprisoned Palestinians. Does Israel actually want any Palestinians left in the strip at all? “At this point, that’s very clearly coming across from senior public Israeli figures who’ve been using genocidal and ethnic cleansing language from day one,” Friedman said. Miller believes the “operating system” of the US-Israeli relationship is still intact, partly owing to Biden’s deep relationship with Israel, engrained in his political DNA. With next year’s election on the horizon, Biden is feeling the squeeze. As Israel’s biggest military backer, there are few lengths to which the US will not go to defend its ally.

China urged an immediate cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, expressed opposition to any forced displacement and relocation of Palestinian civilians and emphasized that any arrangement concerning the future and destiny of the Palestinian people must have their consent, Chinese top diplomat Wang Yi told visiting Arab and Islamic foreign ministers on Monday. China will continue to work with Arab and Islamic countries to promote the full implementation of the relevant resolutions of the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Chinese Vice President Han Zheng said on Monday while meeting the delegation of Arab and Islamic foreign ministers in Beijing. The delegation, which is set to meet officials representing each of the five permanent members of the UN Security Council, is also piling pressure on the West to reject Israel's justification of its actions against Palestinians as self-defense, and Beijing is the first leg of their tour, Reuters reported on Monday. As the rotating presidency of the Security Council, China will continue to strengthen coordination with Arab and Islamic countries, build consensus and push the Security Council to take further meaningful actions on the situation in Gaza, Wang said. In regard to this conflict, China has firmly stood on the side of justice and fairness, has been working hard to de-escalate the conflict, protect civilians, expand humanitarian aid, and prevent humanitarian disasters, and has been calling for a return to the two-state solution and the early settlement of the Palestinian question, Wang said. In the meeting with Arab and Islamic officials, the Chinese Foreign Minister said the pressing task now is to fully implement relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council and the UN General Assembly and achieve an immediate cease-fire and cessation of hostilities. It is a matter of life and death for the people in Gaza. "Also, countries like Saudi Arabia and Egypt could play an important role in the future resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, in which the discussion between those countries and China could focus on some practical issues," Liu said.

# Western 'threat' hype on China's hybrid vehicle sector 'exaggerated', neglects domestic technological accumulation, innovation efforts

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1302252.shtml
<blockquote>
Western media outlets have intensified their hype on Chinese-made vehicles' "threat" to international brands and overseas markets by focusing their attention on the hybrid vehicle segment, a type of vehicle that belongs to the new-energy vehicle (NEV) sector alongside pure electric battery-powered electric models. Japanese automakers have been competitive in the HEV field, where the likes of Toyota have a sizable lead. Sales of pure electric models in October stood at 585,000 units, a year-on-year increase of 14.4 percent, while sales of PHEVs reached 298,000 units, a jump of 78.2 percent. Li Auto sold a record 40,422 vehicles in October, up 302.1 percent on a yearly basis, according to the China Passenger Car Association. "Chinese firms have grasped key technologies in the hybrid sector, and their products are well-received by the market," Xu Haidong, a deputy chief engineer of the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers (CAAM), told the Global Times on Tuesday.

# Experts hail the release of white paper on China’s policies in Xizang

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1302251.shtml
<blockquote>
With the correct policies and leadership of the Communist Party of China (CPC), the development of Southwest China's Xizang Autonomous Region is presented with real examples and data, allowing people to see the true development of Xizang, leaving the separatist forces speechless and can only smear the development in the region, on a Tuesday forum, China's top experts of Tibetology said while discussing a recently-published white paper on China's policies in governing Xizang and the achievements it has gained. This irrefutably shows that Xizang's economic and social development and progress is a typical epitome of China's glorious achievements in construction and development, and is a miracle of human development created by the Chinese path to modernization on the roof of the world. He further noted that the Dalai Lama clique and foreign forces are so passionate that they insist on "representing" the Tibetan people and calling themselves the "masters" of the Tibetan people. Xiao's colleague, Yang Tao, associate researcher at the Institute of Social and Economic Research of the China Tibetology Research Center, stated that judging from the 17 indicators of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), Xizang has reached the forefront or made great progress in many indicators.

# Sunac emerges as China’s first large real estate firm to navigate debt reduction amid policy support

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1302243.shtml
<blockquote>
This restructuring indicated breakthroughs for real estate companies in debt disposal and risk mitigation, Yan Yuejin, research director at Shanghai-based E-house China R&D Institute, said in a note sent to the Global Times on Tuesday. "The more good news related to debt restructuring, the clearer the indications are  that the real estate market and companies are stabilizing," Yan said. "Due to the company's situation, coupled with support policies offered by various local Chinese governments, it was relatively easy for the company to obtain the consent of its creditors and then achieve restructuring," Hui Jianqiang, a veteran industry analyst, told the Global Times on Tuesday. The market expects that more support policies are on the way for the sector, experts said. Many government policies have been announced this year to ease the debt risks of the sector, and with increasing collaborative efforts, the risk of real estate debt is gradually being addressed, experts said. The PBC will actively cooperate with industry regulators and local governments to ensure the stable and healthy development of the real estate market, and efforts will be made to reduce risk levels in the sector and guard against the spillover of risks from the housing market, Pan vowed.

# Pakistan’s Imran Khan trial in jail declared illegal, lawyer says

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/21/jail-trial-of-pakistans-imran-khan-has-been-declared-illegal-lawyer-says
<blockquote>
The trial in jail of Pakistan’s former Prime Minister Imran Khan has been declared illegal by a court, his lawyer has said. The trial against Khan, accused of publicising a classified diplomatic cable, has become a flashpoint in Pakistani politics, where the former leader remains popular and has characterised the charges against him as an effort by powerful interests to keep him out of office. In October, Khan was indicted on security charges that accused him of leaking a diplomatic cable between Washington and Islamabad that Khan says offers proof of collusion against him.

# China to boost talks, cooperation with Europe after ties with US stabilize

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1302241.shtml
<blockquote>
China and the EU, as well as major European powers like France, are going to increase communication and boost cooperation, with analysts saying on Tuesday the China-US tensions have been eased to a certain degree after the San Francisco summit, and this will pave way for Europe to be more pragmatic when developing ties with China. The two sides will also explore cooperation on handling challenges caused by the Ukraine crisis and the Palestine-Israel conflict, said experts. Gao Jian, an expert on European studies at Shanghai International Studies University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that "Although China-EU relations have fluctuated due to the impact caused by the US, the two sides have never departed from the general direction of equality and mutual benefit. During the call with Macron on Monday, Xi said that China is ready to maintain high-level exchanges with France, make sure the next meeting of the China-France high-level dialogue mechanism on people-to-people exchanges is successful, push for new progress in bilateral cooperation in such areas as education, culture and scientific research, and promote friendly exchanges between the two peoples. The French side is willing to take the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between France and China next year as an opportunity to intensify high-level exchanges with China, and deepen exchanges and cooperation in such fields as economy, trade and aviation, as well as people-to-people and cultural exchanges. Protectionism will bring negative effects to globalization as well as China-EU free trade, and it will not benefit the industrial development in specific field for both sides, as the exchanges and cooperation are needed for both sides to better research technologies and develop products, experts noted.

# UK white paper smears China’s growing role in world devt with prejudice

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1302233.shtml
<blockquote>
Chinese permanent representative to the United Nations, Zhang Jun speaks during SC meeting on Maintenance of international peace and security at UN Headquarters in New York on November 20, 2023. The white paper smeared the Chinese development model with accusations on its drawbacks including "lower standards and limited transparency," while underscoring the necessity for the UK to robustly challenge China, especially when British interests are endangered by China's significant financial role, according to the Guardian's report on the white paper, a brainchild of British development minister Andrew Mitchell,. British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak described China as the "biggest challenge of our age to global security and prosperity," after the Group of Seven (G7) summit in May. Li Guangjie told the Global Times on Tuesday that such hostile remarks against China are desperate attempts to tackle its own crisis, showing that the previous colonial empire is deeply troubled by its waning global influence and has met problems in positioning itself in the current world, especially after the turmoil of Brexit. The UK finds itself unable to accept China playing a leading role in world affairs," Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Tuesday.

# GT Voice: Continuity in trade links will support China-Argentina ties

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1302265.shtml
<blockquote>
As the invitation to join the BRICS grouping was just approved in August, these comments from a candidate for the post of foreign minister could be a signal of potential adjustment in Argentina's economic policy and political direction amid public opinion and pressure over a looming recession and rising poverty. On the financial cooperation level, a currency swap line with China helped Argentina avert a default with the IMF twice this year, according to media reports. Apparently, the close economic, trade and investment relations between the two countries are of great significance to Argentina's economic and social development, whether it is promoting economic growth, creating jobs, upgrading infrastructure or expanding exports. The interests of Chinese companies should not be hurt because of a new government or political differences between the two countries. We believe that Argentina's new government will also realize the importance of bilateral economic and trade cooperation, which is conducive to the country's own development.

# BRICS condemns Israel war on Gaza in signal to the West

<blockquote>
Leaders of major emerging economies called for an end to Israel’s war on Gaza on Tuesday, and for a cessation of hostilities on both sides to ease the rapidly deteriorating humanitarian crisis in the Gaza Strip. Advertisement Sign up for Al Jazeera Week in the Middle East Catch up on our coverage of the region, all in one place. In his opening statement at the meeting, the current BRICS chair, President Ramaphosa of South Africa, said that Israel’s actions “are in clear violation of international law” and that the “collective punishment of Palestinian civilians by Israel “is a war crime … tantamount to genocide”. India, though, has not been as vocal and has in fact cracked down on pro-Palestine marches at home, seemingly siding with Israel and its biggest benefactor, the US, in what is seen as a split within the BRICS itself. But that split did not seem glaring at Tuesday’s summit, which experts say is a first-of-its-kind meeting for a group that has previously focused on economic issues. But with a fiery Iran set to join the group, India might not be able to influence how a new BRICS+ will react to Israel, Gruzd said. Earlier this year, South Africa had managed to convince Russia not to send  President Vladimir Putin to the annual BRICS Summit in August because of an ICC arrest warrant issued against him for war crimes committed in Ukraine. Tuesday’s BRICS stance, instigated by South Africa, might push more countries to be vocal in denouncing the war, said Muhammed Desai of Africa4Palestine, an advocacy group. “South Africa is a significant economic and political powerhouse on the African continent as well as a country with one of the most embassies and high commissions in the world,” Desai said.

# ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 final: Five things that went wrong for India

https://www.aljazeera.com/sports/2023/11/21/icc-cricket-world-cup-2023-final-five-things-that-went-wrong-for-india
<blockquote>
Australia are champions for a sixth time after they beat India by six wickets in the ICC Cricket World Cup 2023 final in Ahmedabad. The toss, the pitch and the conditions Rohit Sharma went hard at Australia’s seamers with the two new balls from each end and it paid off to an extent. But when there was a slow pitch and when Cummins’s near-perfect off-cutter got the better of Kohli, the silence in the stadium reflected the nerves of the nation. Towards the end of their innings, the Indian batters once again failed to score a boundary for over an hour. Starc is devastating on any pitch with his skill and aggression as a left-armer. By the end, the ball, scuffed up on the abrasive surface, was reversing and any India hopes of reaching a par score of 280-290 diminished. The pitch was not the same for the trio of Indian seamers as it had been for Australia’s seam attack. The dew, which had saturated Ahmedabad in the days leading up to the game, was not as heavy as expected but the change in conditions under lights was enough to hamper India’s bowlers.

# Film renews call to return Chinese relics

Wang is remembered as the man who discovered the Library Cave at the site, a repository of over 50,000 items dating back to the 4th to the 11th century. Aoyama returned the middle section, while the right section is in the Dunhuang Academy collection. While immediate repatriation may not be feasible due to Britain's domestic rules and other challenges, voices advocating for the return of these artifacts will not cease, as it is not only China, but also countries like Egypt, Syria and Greece that are calling for the return of relics looted or illegally acquired by Britain. The return of cultural artifacts is not just a legal or ethical matter, it is a step toward fostering international understanding and collaboration. However, it is a journey that deserves to be undertaken, as it contributes to the healing of historical wounds and promotes a shared appreciation of humanity's cultural heritage. The case of Stein and the artifacts from Dunhuang prompt reflection on historical acquisitions and their implications for contemporary cultural relations. The global community must strive for a future where cultural heritage is respected, preserved, and shared across borders, fostering a more inclusive and understanding world.

# To ease Palestinian-Israeli conflict, world should heed BRICS' voice: Global Times editorial

<blockquote>
As Chinese President Xi Jinping stated, it is very timely and very important that the BRICS countries meet and speak up for justice and for peace on the Palestinian-Israeli issue. First, the parties to the conflict must end hostilities and achieve a cease-fire immediately, stop all violence and attacks against civilians, release civilians held captive, and act to prevent loss of more lives and spare people from more miseries. These proposals align with the expectations of regional countries and articulate the broad consensus of the BRICS and the international community. From the outbreak of the latest round of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict to the convening of this virtual meeting, China, Russia, Brazil, South Africa and other BRICS members have made efforts to promote a cease-fire in Gaza and prevent the escalation of violence by submitting bills and organizing meetings within the framework of the UN Security Council. BRICS is becoming a symbol and an entity that upholds international justice, and the more influence it has in the international arena, the better it will be for peace and tranquility in the world.

Although one or two single summits may not be enough to solve he conflict directly, the collective appearance and consistent claim of developing countries will be helpful to find a road map for Israeli-Palestinian peace on the basis of a "two-state solution," including the concept of promoting peace and realizing a peaceful coexistence with more specific proposals, experts said. There can be no sustainable peace and security in the Middle East without a just solution to the question of Palestine, Xi said.

The accord is the first truce of a war in which Israel has flattened vast swathes of Gaza, which is home to about 2.3 million people. “In the coming days, more aid will come in, more fuel, hopefully more medical supplies and the most seriously injured can be evacuated, but beyond that, in these coming days of pause there needs to be massive pressure on Israel to not recommence the fighting at the end of this period,” Antony Loewenstein, an independent journalist and author based in Australia, told Al Jazeera.

# US firms account for 20% of foreign exhibitors of China's first supply chain expo: CCPIT

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1302258.shtml
<blockquote>
The number of US exhibitors registered for the first China International Supply Chain Expo (CISCE) is much higher than expected, accounting for 20 percent of all foreign exhibitors, underscoring deepening China-US cooperation in stabilizing global supply chains, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade (CCPIT), the co-organizer of the expo, said on Tuesday during a press conference. A total of 515 Chinese and foreign enterprises and institutions will participate in the CISCE, displaying new technologies, new products and new services in the key links of the global supply chain, the vice chairman said. At a previous press conference, Lin Shunjie, chairman of the China International Exhibition Center Group, a co-organizer of the CISCE, said that the organizers ultimately will only choose 300-400 companies as exhibitors, and each supply chain exhibition area will only have 50-60 companies.

# Israel-Hamas truce: All that you need to know

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/22/israel-hamas-truce-all-you-need-to-know
<blockquote>
After more than six weeks of fighting that has destroyed extensive areas of Gaza and killed thousands, Israel and Palestinian armed group Hamas have agreed to a four-day truce. Since October 7, when Hamas fighters attacked southern Israel and killed 1,200 people, the Israeli army has been relentlessly bombarding Gaza with air and ground attacks, killing more than 14,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children. Here’s what you need to know about the truce deal: What have Israel and Hamas agreed to? As part of the deal, Israel has agreed to release 150 Palestinian women and children from its prisons. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that he had leaned on Biden to secure a better deal for Israel, and thanked the US president for his efforts. Netanyahu also made it clear that the country was not ending its war on Gaza and that the stopping of fighting was only temporary. Hamas has released four people already – two Israeli citizens and two US citizens. Hamas has said 50 captives have been killed in Israeli air raids on the Gaza Strip. On November 15, reports began emerging of Qatari mediators closing in on an agreement between Israel and Hamas for the release of 50 captives in Gaza in exchange for a three-day pause. On Tuesday, Hamas official Izzat al-Rishq told Al Jazeera that a deal had been in talks for weeks but Netanyahu was stalling. “What this [deal] tells you is how difficult things are going to be going forward.

# Analysis: A pause in fighting – what’s in it for Hamas?

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/22/analysis-a-pause-in-fighting-whats-in-it-for-hamas
<blockquote>
The deal that people on all sides of the fighting in Gaza and the international community anticipated and longed for has finally been agreed. True to the uncomfortable and nervous relationship between Israeli and Hamas negotiators, even the duration is vague: Leaks during the last days of the indirect talks have ranged from three to five days. The slight change now is that Netanyahu earned some brownie points with the Israeli public by presenting the Israeli cabinet with the deal, which he was most likely arm-twisted into by Joe Biden. To them, Hamas are terrorists to be killed, eradicated and expelled from the Gaza Strip with captives being released either voluntarily or by force, and they took any suggestion of negotiating with Hamas as an insult and an offence. In just six weeks since October 7, its status changed from “terrorists with whom any negotiations are unacceptable” to “an organisation that has control on the ground”. To be sure, Hamas and Israel have negotiated truces in the past, always through third-party mediation, usually that of Egypt. Hamas command centres are under the ground, Hamas armouries are below the surface, and Hamas tunnels connect those with almost every point in the Gaza Strip – so why would Hamas need a pause in the fighting to regroup if it can do so anyway?

# ‘What’s wrong?’: The silence of Pakistanis on expulsion of Afghan refugees

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/22/whats-wrong-the-silence-of-pakistanis-on-expulsion-of-afghan-refugees
<blockquote>
But since the beginning of the month, those Afghans have been missing from public view after the Pakistan government ordered a crackdown on undocumented refugees and migrants, nearly 1.7 million of them from the neighbouring country. I think this is the right decision. Islamabad blames the refugees for a recent spike in attacks by armed groups, most of them carried out by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), also known as Pakistani Taliban because of its ideological affinity with the Afghan Taliban. Gallup Pakistan, in a survey conducted in the first week of November, found that 84 percent of respondents “strongly approved” the government’s move to expel the “illegal” refugees and migrants, mainly from Afghanistan. “These Afghan families also impacted the rental market in Islamabad, making it difficult for the locals to acquire property,” he told Al Jazeera. But Pakistani sociologist Nida Kirmani believes there is a “great deal of racism” against the Afghans in Pakistan, which she says is due to years of “state-sponsored brainwashing” that framed the Afghans as enemies. “There is public sympathy in some quarters, and there are activists who are trying to demand the government should bring more transparency in the [expulsion] processes, but there is a need to educate people on why Afghans chose to escape Afghanistan and what role did the Pakistani state play in perpetuating the conditions in Afghanistan,” she told Al Jazeera.

# Behind the scenes: How the Israel-Hamas truce deal came together

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/22/behind-the-scenes-how-did-the-israel-hamas-truce-deal-unfold
<blockquote>
That effort, which began in the days after the captives were taken, finally bore fruit with the announcement of a truce mediated by Qatar and Egypt and agreed by Israel, Hamas and the United States. They met with Israeli security forces in Egypt and were transferred to a military base in Israel to be reunited with their family. The return of the two Americans proved it was possible to gain freedom for captives and gave Biden confidence that Qatar could mediate the release of more people, officials said. Sign up Please check your email to confirm your subscription By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy protected by reCAPTCHA October 24 Israel was poised to launch a ground offensive in Gaza, the US side got word that Hamas had agreed to the parameters of a deal to release women and children, which would mean a pause and a delay in the ground invasion. Israel steps up its ground attack on Gaza three days later, on October 27. October 30 According to the Israeli military, a fifth person, a soldier, Private Ori Megidish, was rescued on October 30 during a ground raid inside Gaza. Under the agreement that was taking shape, women and children captives would be freed in a first phase, together with a commensurate release of Palestinian prisoners from the Israelis. The US side agreed and demanded through Qatar a proof of life or identifying information for women and children held by Hamas. The key obstacle at that point was that Hamas had not clearly identified who it was holding. Shortly after Biden’s call, Hamas produced details for the 50 captives it said it would release in the first phase of any deal. Walking out of a meeting, Netanyahu grabbed McGurk’s arm and said that “we need this deal” and urged Biden to call the emir of Qatar on the final terms, one of the officials said. November 18 US Middle East envoy McGurk met in Doha with the Qatari prime minister. The agreement was now structured for women and children to be freed in the first phase but with an expectation for future releases and the aim to bring all captives home to their families. Only one issue remained – the number of captives to be released in the first phase and the ultimate structure of the deal to incentivise releases beyond the 50 known women and children, the officials said. A picture taken in 2018 shows Egypt’s intelligence chief, Major General Abbas Kamel [File: Khaled Desouki/AFP] November 22 On November 22, Israel and Hamas agreed to a temporary pause in the war that would enable the release of the captives.

# Israel neglecting severely burned prisoner’s needs

Those are the words of Israa Jaabis, a 33-year-old Palestinian mother from  Jerusalem who has been languishing in Hasharon, the only Israeli prison for Palestinian female prisoners. She is accused by Israel of attempted murder after blowing her car up at a checkpoint, a charge she denies. Her burns, she claims, are the result of an explosion in the car following a technical fault. Broken on the inside, physically burned, and in an immense amount of pain, Jaabis said last week, in a letter dictated to her lawyer, that she does not receive adequate medical treatment from the Israeli Prison System (IPS).

# China warns US, Philippines not to harm its sovereignty, rights

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1302326.shtml
<blockquote>
China on Wednesday warned the US and the Philippines that their recent joint naval patrols near Chinese territorial waters should not harm China's sovereignty and maritime interests, with analysts saying the military activities by Washington and Manila showed the two countries have no sincerity to ease tension. The militaries of the Philippines and the US launched joint patrols on Tuesday in waters near the island of Taiwan, officials of Manila said, Reuters reported, saying that this could be a move to "fan further tension with China." Security engagements between Washington and Manila have soared this year, including a decision to almost double the number of Philippine bases the American military can access, some of which are facing the island of Taiwan, and their largest-ever joint military drill in April, according to the report. "When the US wants to use its ally to present its military hegemony in the relevant waters, the Philippines is trying to use the US military presence to back its illegal claim over the South China Sea, and Manila also wants Washington to provide more military assistances." Wei Dongxu, a Beijing-based military expert, voiced a similar opinion, as he told the Global Times on Wednesday that the US did not send very capable forces to the joint patrol, and the Philippine forces' capabilities are limited. The island of Taiwan is only little more than a hundred kilometers away from there, so the US military is also in fact preparing for a potential military interference in the Taiwan question, Zhang said.

# GT Voice: India shouldn’t let Australia derail cooperation with China

<blockquote>
During his visit to India this week, Marles on Monday described China as a source of both national wealth and anxiety, according to both Indian and Australian media reports. But the Australian government has clearly chosen the path of pragmatic cooperation, which is conducive to both countries and their peoples, after having recognized the importance of trade with China to the Australian economy. China has been one of India's largest trading partners for many years, and bilateral economic and trade cooperation has brought tangible benefits to businesses in both countries. But it is true that due to border disputes and other geopolitical factors, the development of China-India economic and trade relations has faced obstacles in recent years. If India really moves toward reducing China trade or wants to replace China's role in the global industry chain because of the so-called security issues, it will only increase the economic burden on its people and undermine the competitiveness of its own exports, thus blocking its transformation toward a manufacturing power.

North Korea has said the satellite is necessary for it to deal with alleged threats from South Korea and the United States, and will improve its ability to monitor its neighbour.

She constantly worries about him because when Ubai was arrested by Israeli forces on August 8, four months after his 18th birthday, he only had 30 percent use of one of his hands. I was so scared for his health because of the injury to his hand and because he hadn’t had a chance to get the surgery he was scheduled for. “Since October 7, we’ve been hearing that things got worse for prisoners in the occupation prisons, that they were all assaulted and deprived of the most basic rights such as food, clothing, things like that.” He follows Hebrew media, and he woke me up early in the morning to tell me Ubai’s name is on the list. “I’ve been arrested before, and given the 30 times I was arrested, I see the release of my son as if he’s going to be reborn.

# China welcomes temporary cease-fire between Hamas and Israel, urging more efforts to cool tensions

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1302279.shtml
<blockquote>
The two sides in the Israel-Hamas conflict have agreed to a four-day cease-fire in the Gaza Strip and the release of at least 50 hostages held in Gaza. Chinese observers said this positive sign could indicate a temporary cooling down of the situation, which was achieved due to multiple factors including mounting pressure that both Israel and Hamas have been facing, the latest UN Security Council resolution adopted under China's rotating presidency, the strong voice of the Global South through the latest BRICS extraordinary virtual summit, and the active mediation of the Arab world. Israel and Hamas agreed to a Qatar-mediated deal for a four-day truce in Gaza and the release of 50 captives held in the enclave in exchange for 150 Palestinians imprisoned in Israel, according to media reports. As the humanitarian crisis in Gaza continued to unfold, Israel has been facing mounting pressure both domestically and internationally to end its offensive in Gaza. "We wouldn't say this four-day truce would be a major turning point in the Israel-Hamas conflict but it's more like a short-term buffer as both Hamas militants and Israel have been facing external pressure," Zhu Yongbiao, director of the Center for Afghanistan Studies at Lanzhou University, told the Global Times on Wednesday. Establishing a more authoritative international mechanism likely will still need to be centered around the UN, Liu said.

# Netherlands voters head to the polls in tight election

<blockquote>
“It’s been enough now. Dutch far-right politician and leader of the PVV party, Geert Wilders votes during the Dutch parliamentary elections, in The Hague [Yves Herman/Reuters] I tossed a coin and chose one,” Vincent Spijker, a 54-year-old quality control manager, told the Agence France-Presse news agency after casting his vote. The election will bring the Netherlands its first new prime minister in 13 years after Rutte concludes his tenure as the country’s longest-serving leader. A self-proclaimed fan of Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, Wilders is explicitly anti-EU, urging the Netherlands to take back control of its borders, to significantly reduce its payments to the union and block the entrance of any new members.

# Chinese netizens let their imaginations run wild as Sam Altman returns to OpenAI

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1302314.shtml
<blockquote>
Within days, Sam Altman, who had been ousted from OpenAI's board, will be back in charge of the company. Previously more than 730 employees signed a letter demanding that the board dissolve and bring Altman back, or they too will resign. The topic of the internal power fight within OpenAI has swept across Chinese social media, with some writing on Sina Weibo that "OpenAI has done in a few days what other companies took decades to do," while others joked that "Even Netflix couldn't write this, or maybe David Fincher is making another movie with Jesse Eisenberg in the lead." The reason why China did not spark a controversy over risk prevention and accelerated development is because the Chinese government reacted quickly in AI governance with several regulations already issued while AI companies rushed to explore the possibilities of AI, Zhu Rongsheng, an assistant researcher at the Center for Strategic and Security Studies, Tsinghua University, shared his insight with the Global Times.

# Exclusive: Australian lobsters and wine to China likely to resume as relations warm up: industry insiders

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1302315.shtml
<blockquote>
Following the resumption of Australia's barley exports to China in October, which was a fresh sign of improved trade ties, more Australian exports to China such as lobsters and wine are likely to resume, industry sources told the Global Times on Wednesday. China resumed imports of Australia's barley in October, with the amount reaching 313,700 tons worth $88.4 million, according to data released by the General Administration of Customs on Monday. From January to September, China imported 169,000 tons of beef from Australia, a year-on-year rise of 26.5 percent, making Australia the third-largest source of beef imports, the Global Times learned from the China Meat Association (CMA) on Wednesday. The growth reflected multiple factors including the sustained improvement in bilateral economic and trade relations and a recovery in market confidence, a source with the CMA told the Global Times. Other issues, such as lobster import suspensions due to food safety concerns, are also likely being addressed, Chen said.

# ‘Important but not enough’: What does Israel-Hamas deal mean for US policy?

<blockquote>
But they stress that the truce is not sufficient, with many pledging to continue pressuring the administration of US President Joe Biden to pursue a long-term ceasefire. The exchange will be accompanied by a four-day pause in the fighting and an increased delivery of humanitarian aid into the besieged Palestinian territory. Israel has pledged to continue its military campaign after the pause. But El-Tayyab stressed that “more war” is not the answer, and that there is no military solution to the crisis. A truce or a pause is a temporary halt of fighting for an agreed-upon period of time — in this case, four days. But Biden’s support for Israel is not expected to waver after the pause. “My reading of the Netanyahu government is that they’re incorrigible, that nothing would stand in their way if they want to start back up the destruction,” Cole told Al Jazeera. Usamah Andrabi, communications director at Justice Democrats, a progressive group, called for the US to end its unconditional support for the Israeli government that “continues to openly tell us its plans to annihilate and displace the Palestinian people”. Andrabi said the pause is a temporary but necessary reprieve from the “incessant bombing and destruction by the Israeli government”, which will allow for the release of captives. “But we cannot let up on our demands for a permanent ceasefire,” Andrabi told Al Jazeera. We have to continue to push the US government to call for a complete ceasefire,” Tamari told Al Jazeera.

# Hamas deal divides Israel politicians, seen as ‘great harm’, ‘painful’

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/22/hamas-truce-receives-mixed-reactions-from-israeli-politicians
<blockquote>
Ben-Gvir also said on Wednesday that Israel was repeating the mistakes of the past, referring to a 2011 deal when more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners were freed in return for Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who had been held by Hamas for five years. Questions from lawmakers were answered by members of Israel’s military and intelligence establishment, who sought to allay concerns that a pause in the fighting could stunt Israeli momentum after more than a month of relentless strikes on Gaza. Netanyahu has made clear that the agreement does not mean the war will stop, and vowed that the Israeli military will press on after the pause in fighting. Israel has cut off access to food, fuel, and electricity for Gaza’s more than 2.3 million residents and wiped out entire neighbourhoods in an assault that Palestinian authorities say has killed more than 14,000 people, with more than 5,600 of them children. They were abducted here, in Israel, from their beds,” said Regional Cooperation Minister David Amsalem, a member of Netanyahu’s right-wing Likud Party.

# WHO asks China for more details on unexplained pneumonia outbreak

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/23/who-asks-china-for-more-details-on-unexplained-pneumonia-outbreak
<blockquote>
The World Health Organization (WHO) has asked Beijing for more information on an outbreak of mysterious pneumonia in northern China that appears mostly to be affecting children. The WHO made “an official request for detailed information on an increase in respiratory illnesses and reported clusters of pneumonia in children,”  the United Nations health agency said in a statement on Wednesday. The WHO noted that China’s National Health Commission told a press conference earlier this month that there had been an increase in the incidence of respiratory diseases, attributing them to the lifting of COVID-19 measures and the spread not only of COVID-19 but pathogens such as influenza, mycoplasma pneumoniae (a common bacterial infection which typically affects younger children), and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Noting that it was unclear whether the outbreak in northern China and the overall increase in respiratory infections previously reported by Chinese authorities were linked, the WHO said it had asked Beijing for more detailed information on the situation.

# ‘Can regain our soul’: Relief and fear in Gaza ahead of Israel truce

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/23/can-regain-our-soul-relief-and-fear-in-gaza-ahead-of-israel-truce
<blockquote>
Deir el-Balah and Fukhari, Gaza Strip — After more than six weeks of war, Khaled Loz knows what he wants to do when the truce announced on Wednesday by Israel and Hamas finally comes into effect. “It’s the first thing I want to do. Now, the declaration of a four-day truce that could come into effect soon is promising the first hope of some respite for Gaza’s people. But it is also the first opportunity for thousands of families to finally grieve loved ones lost in the bombing. But there is no such guarantee of movement towards the north, where Gaza City is based, so it is unclear whether those like Loz who want to search for missing relatives in the north will be able to make their way there. He doesn’t know if his house is still standing — the United Nations estimates that half of north Gaza’s homes have been damaged or destroyed in the bombing — but he says he would prefer to “live in a tent in our neighbourhood” than as a displaced person. “I tell them I pray that they are OK — but that the most important thing is that you are OK.”

Stuart Seldowitz, 64, who previously served as deputy director of the US State Department’s Office of Israel and Palestinian Affairs, was arrested on Wednesday on charges of aggravated harassment, hate crime stalking, stalking causing fear, and stalking at a place of employment, New York police said in a statement. “The comments I made calling him out for his support of terrorism – those I think were appropriate.” After Seldowitz’s actions went viral, New Yorkers rallied to support the vendor, lining up to buy chicken and rice at the food cart in Manhattan’s Upper East Side neighbourhood on Tuesday.

# As Israel pounds Gaza, BBC journalists accuse broadcaster of bias

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/23/as-israel-pounds-gaza-bbc-journalists-accuse-broadcaster-of-bias
<blockquote>
In a 2,300-word letter written to Al Jazeera by eight UK-based journalists employed by the corporation, the BBC is also said to be guilty of a “double standard in how civilians are seen”, given that it is “unflinching” in its reporting of alleged Russian war crimes in Ukraine. At the time of writing, more than 14,500 Palestinians have been reported as killed by Israeli bombardment, including at least 6,000 children. “Thousands of Palestinians have been killed since October 7. The Hamas assault, while “appalling and devastating … does not justify the indiscriminate killing of thousands of Palestinian civilians, and the BBC cannot be seen to support – or fail to interrogate – the logic that it does,” their letter reads. “But for many of us – especially people of colour – the BBC’s coverage has been part of our distress,” the letter says. Further critiquing the BBC’s storytelling, the journalists argue that while Palestinians have been asked whether they “condemn Hamas”, the same cannot be said for guests who defend Israel’s actions. The letter also claims that the BBC is failing to provide audiences with important background about Israel’s occupation and the history of Palestinian suffering. It is no more complex than any other conflict,” the letter reads. In an email sent to Al Jazeera, the spokesperson said: “Throughout our reporting on the conflict the BBC has made clear the devastating human cost to civilians living in Gaza and Israel.” They added that the BBC is “one of the only news organisations” to have journalists inside Gaza, who have been able to provide “on the ground reporting”. “This has included many stories of Palestinian victims and first-hand testimony from civilians, doctors and aid-workers in Gaza, as well as a Panorama documentary, featuring human stories from both sides,” they said. The spokesperson also sent a list of examples of BBC coverage on the war, which included human stories of Palestinian suffering. The summary is an example of the kind of language in Western media outlets that many have criticised; Israelis are described as being “murdered by Hamas fighters”, but Palestinians are “killed” by a nameless actor. On October 25, The Times newspaper, citing a BBC source, reported that staff had been “crying in the toilets” over the “distress caused” by coverage that they alleged was too lenient on Israel. What’s more, their coverage of Israeli deaths is *increasing* as more Palestinians are dying”.

In August, China brokered a peace deal between Iran and Saudi Arabia, which re-established their diplomatic ties and had analysts saying it was a sign that the Middle East was turning away from the United States as a major ally. “China being the first destination visited is a message to the United States,” Randa Slim, senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, told Al Jazeera. Arab leaders – Egypt and Saudi Arabia in particular – recently warned US Secretary of State Antony Blinken that this strategy has contributed to instability in the region. “This is part of efforts to galvanize global support … and increase pressure on the Israeli government,” Mogielnicki said. Regardless of how frustrated they are with the unflinching US support for Israel, Arab leaders know the power to stop the carnage rests with the US.

# Will Iran give Russia ballistic missiles for the war in Ukraine?

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/23/will-iran-give-russia-ballistic-missiles-for-the-war-in-ukraine
<blockquote>
Tehran, Iran – The United States has renewed its warnings that Iran may be preparing to provide Russia with advanced ballistic missiles for use in the war in Ukraine. What are Washington’s allegations? Western governments said Iran has been supplying Russia with hundreds of so-called kamikaze drones that have been used in the war and have imposed many rounds of sanctions on Iranian individuals and entities in response. Tehran’s official stance on the war has consisted of saying its roots are in NATO’s unchecked expansion, it wants the war to end through dialogue and it supplied Moscow with drones as part of bilateral defence cooperation but months before the war began. From a purely military standpoint, it would make sense for Iran to provide Russia with precision-guided ballistic missiles, according to Fabian Hinz, a military analyst at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. And the Iranians, in turn, have mass-production capability for various precision-guided munitions and suicide drones that could help Russia in the war in Ukraine,” the analyst said. Iran may be using military visits with Russian officials to showcase its military assets and also as sort of a “bargaining process” to persuade Moscow to provide it with more advanced arms, the analyst believes. There are both political reasons – on the EU-Iran level –and strategic reasons between Russia and Iran that are not in favour of such a decision.

Russian President Vladimir Putin reacted to criticism of his war in Ukraine from the world’s wealthiest nations, now in its 91st week, by holding up Israel’s war in Gaza for comparison.

Advertisement The ground war Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said troops were still launching counteroffensive actions on the southern front in the 91st week of the war, but had gone on the defensive in the east. The figures were possibly cumulative for the entire period of this bridgehead action, which started approximately a month ago, when a Russian reporter said Ukrainian reconnaissance units had reached the outskirts of Krynky, 20km (12.4 miles) east of Kherson City on the left bank. “Russian forces have not constructed extensive visible defensive fortifications … and appear to have opted for more discrete fortifications set further from the frontline,” the ISW wrote. The worst came on the night of November 17-18, when Ukraine said it downed 29 out of 38 drones. Finland said it was preparing to shut all but one of its eight border crossings with Russia on November 22. “Russia is effectively instrumentalising people, not only letting people through to the Finnish border with invalid documents or missing documents, which has not been the case before, but also we have evidence that Russia is effectively bringing those people to the border and organizing transport as well,” foreign minister Elina Valtonen told Reuters on November 21.

Although the cause of this trend is unclear, some health experts are attributing it to a common and temporary aftereffect of lifting lockdown restrictions, even as unanswered questions around the infections and the country of their spread have led others to draw parallels with the early days of the pandemic.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/23/mixed-reactions-among-palestinians-israelis-over-prisoner-captive-exchange
<blockquote>
Images that no one can comprehend,” she told Al Jazeera. Mediator Qatar announced on Thursday that Israel and Hamas agreed to a four-day pause in fighting, which includes the exchange of some of the captives taken by Palestinian group Hamas during an attack in southern Israel on October 7, for Palestinian prisoners in Israeli custody. Who among the long list of Palestinian prisoners will be allowed to leave and when is in the hands of the Israeli authorities. Nisreen al-Titi, also from Nablus, and the sister of a Palestinian prisoner, told Al Jazeera that she has mixed emotions about her possible release. It remains unclear if her sister Aseel – who has been in prison for more than a year after being accused by Israel of trying to stab an Israeli guard while visiting her incarcerated brother – will be freed. “I didn’t win the lottery,” said Guy Metzger, after hearing that his mother was not among the first group of Israelis set to be released. “Right now Israelis are supporting the continuation of the war, but there will be a moment in which Israel will have to ask herself – until when and what will come after and at what price are we going to continue? Basravi reported that “people say they are grateful about the ceasefire but they feel it will be an incomplete happiness if their loved ones are not released”, adding that many fear a truce in Gaza would mean an uptick in the already intensifying raids in the occupied West Bank.

# China-US flight number rises but still insufficient: Global Times editorial

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1302434.shtml
<blockquote>
The number of weekly direct roundtrip flights between the two countries only reached double digits in the beginning of this year and has been continuously increasing since May. This is highly welcomed by the societies of both China and the US, and it is also one of the achievements of the restoration and strengthening of high-level communications between the two countries. It is not difficult to see that every piece of news about the resumption of direct flights between China and the US has received a lot of attention on social media platforms in both countries. Compared to the peak period of over 300 flights per week and over 5 million people-to-people exchanges per year between China and the US, there is still a lot of room for growth in the number of flights. The desire for communication and cooperation between the peoples of China and the US has always been strong. The communication between the people of China and the US is constrained by the political relations between the two countries, but it in turn plays a role in promoting the improvement of China-US political relations. Some in Washington don't want to see the restoration of people-to-people exchanges between China and the US.

# Iran’s top diplomat discusses Israel’s war in Gaza with Hezbollah leader

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/23/irans-top-diplomat-discusses-israels-war-in-gaza-with-hezbollah-leader
<blockquote>
The Israeli army hit several areas in southern Lebanon in retaliation, according to Lebanon’s National News Agency. Hezbollah says it has been acting in support of Hamas since the Palestinian group’s surprise October 7 incursion in southern Israel, which Israeli officials say killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and saw about 240 people taken captive. The violence between Israel and Hezbollah has killed at least 108 people in Lebanon, most of them Hezbollah fighters, but also at least 14 civilians, including three journalists, the AFP news agency reported.

# US urged to translate promise of ‘not intending to suppress, contain China’ into action: MOFCOM

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1302397.shtml
<blockquote>
Shu referred to the China-US summit in San Francisco last week, during which the Chinese and US leaders met and set the direction for the  healthy, stable and sustainable development of bilateral relations. Shu noted that the push for "decoupling" and so-called "de-risking" would only artificially interfere with normal investment and operations by enterprises, which would not be in the fundamental interests of companies in either country. She added that the self-imposed restrictions of the US would put its own companies at a disadvantage in global competition.

# ‘Just as scared’: Cyberscam victims in Cambodia find no freedom in rescue

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/24/just-as-scared-cyberscam-victims-in-cambodia-find-no-freedom-in-rescue
<blockquote>
We were just as scared in both places,” said Ramos Miembro, who was stopped in September as a Chinese trafficking ring was taking her from a compound in northern Cambodia to Sihanoukville, a casino town on the southern coast. “The police told us they were waiting for the mafia boss to pay the big money to send us back to the traffickers.” Advertisement Sign up for Al Jazeera Week in the Middle East Catch up on our coverage of the region, all in one place. Instead, she was driven from the airport to O’Smach, an isolated outpost six hours away on the Cambodian side of the border. Too frightened, she says, to argue with the traffickers who paid for her flight and confiscated her phone, she was taken into a high-walled compound behind a casino and told she could not leave without paying a $5,000 ransom – far more than she could ever hope to afford. She told Al Jazeera that her boss paid $30,000 a month to local police for protection. They told us if we told them about the location in O’Smach then they would kill us.” For several days following their rescue, police at the Anti-Commercial Gambling Crimes Department told them they planned to sell the group back to the gang. A source in the Cambodian police, who asked not to be named for fear of repercussions, told Al Jazeera that it is increasingly common for immigration police (who are typically responsible for processing and holding victims before they can be returned home), to orchestrate so-called rescues with a view to extracting bribes from scam groups and trafficking rings who want the victims back. The source claimed that, in October, he was directly involved in selling a group of trafficking victims held in the detention centre opposite Phnom Penh International Airport back to the Chinese criminal gang that had enslaved them. “I am so upset now and I don’t know why they want money from victims. But two months after their rescue, despite sustained negotiations from their embassy and pressure from rights groups, the group is still waiting for their release papers to be signed so they can fly back to the Philippines, and are losing hope that they will make it home for Christmas. Hundreds of thousands of people have been tricked into travelling overseas for respectable-sounding office jobs, only to find themselves sold to organised crime syndicates and forced to work in scam compounds [File: Cindy Liu/Reuters] Neil, who asked us to use only his first name,  confirmed that he received a wrong number text from a woman who said she was a Chinese investor working in the city of London, and that the conversation had turned into “a bit of a flirt” with no mention of money until she mentioned in passing that she’d been making money from the platform. He was shocked to discover that the text had come from Ramos Miembro – and that she had been trafficked into the role. A manager at the hotel-casino part of the O’Smach Resort complex, who gave his name as Khong, said he knew nothing about the workings of the scam compound and hung up the phone.

# ‘We won’t leave’: Armenians in Jerusalem push back against armed settlers

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/24/we-wont-leave-armenians-in-jerusalem-push-back-against-armed-settlers
<blockquote>
Old City, occupied East Jerusalem – After learning that settlers had returned to bulldoze in an area of the parking lot near his house in the Armenian Quarter, 80-year-old Garo Nalbandian, a professional photographer, joined a community sit-in in the area known as the Cows’ Garden with, of course, his trusty camera. “We won’t leave,” a determined Nalbandian said gruffly in between snapping photos of Armenians on one side of the makeshift barricade and Israeli police and hired security on the other. Since then, representatives from the company, Xana Gardens, have sent contractors, armed settlers and bulldozers to seize the land – which, along with the parking lot, includes Armenian Church property and the homes of Nalbandian and four other families. If I don’t have bread, I call my friend,” said Setrag Balian, 26, one of the leaders of the current movement to reverse the land deal. “We have like a big family for the Armenians. The Armenian Patriarchate of Jerusalem – the community’s spiritual leadership, biggest employer and de facto landlord – struck a deal in July that year with Xana Gardens, a company incorporated that same month and led by the Australian Israeli investor Danny Rothman. A plan submitted by Danny Rothman to the Jerusalem Municipality in May sought 14,500sq metres – not 11,500 – for the hotel, with a “target area” of 16,000sq metres (172,222sq feet), according to the report on the deal. “Either somebody got money under the table to pass this deal, or it’s just our people are so dumb that they don’t know the prices in this country,” said Krikorian. But the Armenians refused to leave. “It’s because this deal is not a good deal for the patriarchate. “Just by the look on Danny Rothman’s face,” said Kegham Balian, “you could tell he wasn’t expecting the events to unfold like they did that day.” “They thought it would scare us,” said Setrag Balian of the armed threats. Since the first armed confrontation by Rothman and settlers, Armenians have been taking shifts at the Cows’ Garden, where two bulldozers are parked. Contractors hired by Xana Gardens attempted to bulldoze the area early in the morning on November 12 and 13. As demolition attempts by the company continue – including an incident on November 15 in which Palestinians hired by Xana Gardens to dismantle the barricade left when they realised they had been hired by settlers – the community remains resolute. During the standoffs, police threatened to arrest Armenians, and several have been arrested for transgressions like shouting, according to community members.

# How a rejected Thanksgiving speech forged an Indigenous holiday tradition

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/23/how-a-rejected-thanksgiving-speech-forged-an-indigenous-holiday-tradition
<blockquote>
On the fourth Thursday of November, timed to the US Thanksgiving holiday, she and other members of the group United American Indians of New England (UAINE) gather in Plymouth, Massachusetts, to hold a National Day of Mourning. “I really liked the idea that there were Native people in New England — some of whom had been told growing up that they were extinct — that were there speaking about their history and what was going on with them now.” It was at the ceremony that she met the late Indigenous leader Wamsutta Frank James, who would eventually be the grandfather to her twin children. An Aquinnah Wampanoag man, James was among the founders of the National Day of Mourning in 1970. We have allowed the white man to keep us on our knees,” Frank wrote in his suppressed speech. And I think there was this idea that he was going to come and praise the Pilgrims. They thought that he would come and say, “Oh, we’re so grateful that the Pilgrims came, and we all got along, and everything has been great.” He certainly couldn’t go and praise the Pilgrims, but he also felt it was important to tell the truth about what had happened. Thanksgiving was not a happy time for him or other Wampanoag people because it represents a celebration of the invasion and all the devastation that would follow for Indigenous people in the region. So he was very clear about that. Al Jazeera: How do you think that the rejection of the speech shaped him as a person and as a leader? He was not going to give a speech in praise of the Pilgrims and all the good that they had supposedly done for Indigenous peoples, when that was completely counter to any historical reality. When he got to the end of his courses at the New England Conservatory, he was told by his primary teacher, who cared about him very much: “You’re the best trumpet player in this class, but no symphony orchestra in the country will hire you because of the colour of your skin.” I think that’s why he felt strongly — well before 1970 — that it was important for Indigenous people in the region to be united and to work together to assert themselves as Indigenous people and to demand respect from the white people. Wamsutta Frank James, left, helped to found the National Day of Mourning after his speech for a 1970 Thanksgiving celebration was suppressed [Courtesy of UAINE] What I learned from him is to just keep doing this, because it’s really important to do this kind of educational work and speak truth to power and tell the truth about our history. Al Jazeera: Have you ever heard any pushback about the National Day of Mourning?

# End of an era: How corruption in Liberia cost George Weah the presidency

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/23/end-of-an-era-how-corruption-in-liberia-cost-george-weah-the-presidency
<blockquote>
His election win made headlines across the world, and his inauguration speech seemed as convincing as his ball-striking prowess had been. However, one issue stands out: corruption. It drove some of the biggest protests the country has seen since the end of Liberia’s second civil war in 2003. An inquiry by Kroll, a Philadelphia-based firm funded by the United States government, revealed that the banknotes had not gone missing but had been illegally printed. Two months before the missing banknotes scandal, Weah had injected US$25m into the economy to extract the excess Liberian dollars in circulation. In the different reports that we’ve done over the years, citizens have expressed disappointment in the government’s lack of strong will to deal with corruption,” Miamen said. After four national auditors died in just over a week in 2020, public mistrust of the Weah government over corruption heightened in the country of 5.2 million people. First, Albert Peters and Gifty Lama of the Liberia Revenue Authority were discovered dead in a car in Monrovia on October 2. His body was found lying outside his home with head wounds in the same neighborhood as Fahnboto. However, the US sanctioned three senior members of Weah’s government over corruption.

# Analysis: How to enforce the Israel-Hamas truce

<blockquote>
list of 4 items list 1 of 4 Anticipation builds in Gaza as Israel-Hamas truce to begin list 2 of 4 Hamas says 30 killed in Israeli attack on UN school ahead of Gaza truce list 3 of 4 What are the details of the truce between Israel and Hamas? Hamas fighters set up ambushes to incapacitate as many tanks and armoured personnel carriers as possible before the ceasefire stops all military activity for 96 hours. The last two days must have been the most nerve-racking for fighters on both sides since the beginning of the ground campaign. An alleged reason that postponed the pause was that the agreement was not formally signed by Qatar and Hamas, “only officially announced”. More red tape was involved in “clarifying the names on the lists of those to be released”. To start with, some officers are chosen to study the agreement and, knowing the situation on the battlefield, determine how they will carry it out. At what point will they be released or transferred from one set of buses to another? What happens if they cannot agree on some issues? As announced by Qatar on Thursday, the first captives are to be released at 4pm on Friday, just nine hours after the fighting is supposed to stop.

# Pro-Palestine or a trend? China’s stance on Israel-Hamas war splits opinion

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/24/pro-palestinian-or-following-trends-chinas-stance-on-israel-hamas-war
<blockquote>
When Chinese President Xi Jinping called for a ceasefire and an end to the “collective punishment” of the people of Gaza on the sidelines of the BRICS summit this week, his comments added to a steady drumbeat of criticism of Israel since the start of its war with Hamas. Beijing waited until a day after Hamas’s October 7 attacks on Israel to call on the “relevant parties” to end hostilities and stress the need for a two-state solution, and did not condemn the Palestinian armed group or mention it by name. China, which has expressed its desire to be a peace broker in the Middle East, this week welcomed the announcement of the four-day truce between Israel and Hamas that took effect on Friday. “It has refrained from describing the Hamas incursion into Israel as a terrorist attack but has called Israel’s retaliation ‘collective punishment’ of Palestinian civilians – signalling its opposition to an Israeli ground invasion of Gaza.” It has consistently called for a ceasefire, the need to avoid a spill-over of the conflict and the need to host a broader peace conference with a clear roadmap for a two-state solution,” Kewalramani said. “And overall, international public opinion is becoming increasingly unfavourable to Israel, which also shows that China’s position is not biased against Israel,” he said. “Since US policies seem to be more aligned with Israel, it is not surprising that China tends to align with Palestine, which is also viewed as the underdog,” Ho told Al Jazeera.

The key components are a pause in the fighting, the exchange of Hamas captives for Palestinians held in Israeli prisons, and a halt to air traffic over northern Gaza during certain hours of the day and over southern Gaza entirely. In exchange, Israel will release a total of 150 Palestinian women and children held in Israeli prisons, whom Palestinians have long characterised as victims of an Israeli occupation that sweeps them into prisons with little pretence of due process. Israeli Army Radio has said that the first batch of 39 Palestinian prisoners will be released at about 8pm (18:00 GMT) on Friday, and that this will only occur if the hostages held in Gaza are on Israeli soil.

# Israel-Hamas truce comes into effect: How it could now unfold

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/24/israel-hamas-truce-comes-into-effect-how-it-could-now-unfold
<blockquote>
end of list Despite this, the pause in fighting would be a lifeline for many Palestinians, an opportunity for them to recuperate and “take out people from under rubble”, Hamayel told Al Jazeera. Israel, while signalling it has no intention of ending the war, may also prefer a longer pause as the war is draining its economy and affecting its tourism, said Hamayel. Hamas doesn’t want to lose credibility with its mediators, while the situation for Palestinian civilians is too dire for the group to risk not giving them a respite from fighting, said Hamayel. But Hamas and its regional allies would not take Israel’s breaking of the truce lightly, with the Palestinian armed group expected to fire missiles on Israel in response, and the possibility of a gradual escalation in tensions on multiple fronts of the war, said Hamayel. It is also possible that Hamas may break the truce, with such a response not only prompting Western ire at the group, but it would likely ramp up Israeli aggression from both the air and ground, he added. On Thursday, Israel’s Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said that the war would continue for at least another two months after the end of the truce. But international pressure for a ceasefire is mounting.

# Dublin riots: What to know about the stabbing attack and clashes in Ireland

Police said it appeared a man in his 50s attacked a number of people shortly after 13:30 GMT on Thursday. Vehicles were set on fire and shops looted after a knife attack at a school in central Dublin on November 23, 2023 [Clodagh Kilcoyne/Reuters] Who was attacked? Who was behind the attack in Dublin? The attack took place at Parnell Square East in Dublin. Another man took the knife and put it away for the [police] to find it.” Kearney added a group of people restrained the suspect on the ground as some of those injured were taken back inside the school. What was the motive behind the attack? Geraghty said police believe the attack was “a standalone incident, not necessarily connected to any wider issues that are ongoing in the country or in the city, and we need to identify the exact reasons for that happening”. The Dublin City Council Traffic and Incident Management Centre said O’Connell Street northbound is closed while Parnell Square East and North are closed. “We are particularly thinking of the five-year-old girl and the member of staff caring for her who are both in serious condition in hospital. All of our prayers are with each of them for a full recovery.” Higgins also said police deserve “all of our support in dealing with the incident”.

At least two Palestinians are reported to have been killed by the Israeli military, and 11 wounded, as they have attempted the trip to northern Gaza. An AP journalist reported seeing two bodies and the wounded as they arrived at a hospital. “Residents of Gaza, the movement of the population from the south of the Strip to the north will not be allowed in any way, but only from the north to the south,” it read.

The first pause in the fighting was met with huge relief by Palestinians, who were rejoicing to be safe from Israeli bombardment for the first time in weeks,  Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum reported from Khan Younis, southern Gaza.

Qatar will monitor the truce in real time for possible violations, reported Al Jazeera’s James Bays from Doha. “The idea is that if there is any sort of violation, that because of those direct links, they are going to try and nip it in the bud and make sure that this truce can continue, that this process can continue for the four days,” he added.

# From Khalistan to tourism dollars: Pakistan’s love-hate ties with its Sikhs

<blockquote>
He was assassinated in June 1984 during Operation Blue Star, in which the Indian army entered the Golden Temple in Amritsar, Punjab, during a major religious event. “In those days [the mid- and late 1980s], you would see banners [saying] ‘Khalistan Zindabad’ (‘Long Live Khalistan’) and pictures of Bhindranwale all over the gurdwara,” said Madan Singh*, a resident of Nankana Sahib, a city in Punjab, Pakistan. These were some of the holiest shrines associated with the religion, but without the presence of the community – and with the indifference of the Pakistani state towards its non-Muslim heritage – most of these gurdwaras fell into disrepair. A few prominent ones, such as Gurdwara Janam Asthan at Nankana Sahib and Gurdwara Panja Sahib at Hassan Abdal, were looked after by one or two Sikh families who had either remained in what became Pakistan or come over from India just to look after these places of worship. Gurdwara Panja Sahib in Hassan Abdal, Pakistan, was one of the gurdwaras that a few Sikh families who had remained in Pakistan looked after following the partition of Pakistan and India [Rida Arif/Al Jazeera] Places of worship – once again During the heyday of the Khalistan movement, as prominent expat leaders from around the world came to Pakistan, leaders like Ganga Singh also took up the cause of renovation of these sacred spaces with the Pakistani state. Thousands moved to Nankana Sahib and other cities like Peshawar, where there were already Sikh communities. Today, there is a thriving Sikh community of about 1,500 at Nankana Sahib, according to the latest census, ensuring that not just Gurdwara Janam Asthan but all the other gurdwaras of the city are being looked after and have become places of worship once again. With Nankana Sahib being an important base for the community in Punjab, many Sikhs have also now moved to other cities in the province, ensuring that more gurdwaras are being reconverted into sacred spaces. This process, through which the Sikh community is ensuring its presence around different gurdwaras in Pakistan, began with the Khalistan movement. What was also pivotal in the redevelopment of these abandoned Sikh gurdwaras was the changing attitude of the Pakistani state towards Sikh heritage in the aftermath of the movement. Gurdwara Sacha Sauda at Farooqabad, Gurdwara Bhai Biba Singh in Peshawar, Gurdwara Bairi Sahib in Sialkot, Gurdwara Shaheed Gunj in Lahore and Gurdwara Dera Sahib at Kartarpur are just a few examples of the gurdwaras that have been renovated and opened for Sikh pilgrims over the past four decades. Gurdwara Bairi Sahib in Sialkot is one of a number of gurdwaras in Pakistan that have been renovated and opened to Sikh pilgrims [Iqbal Qaiser/Al Jazeera] Gurdwaras – ‘low-hanging fruit’ The initial renovation of these gurdwaras – facilitated by the Pakistani state, sometimes through direct support and at other times by making it easier for the expat Sikh community and organisations to send money into the country – may have taken place to appease the expat Sikh community, which supported the Khalistan movement over the years.

# ‘A place to fly’ – Jenin Freedom Theatre stands defiant amid Israeli raids

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/25/a-place-to-fly-jenin-freedom-theatre-stands-defiant-amid-israeli-raids
<blockquote>
One of the more disturbing things that Ranin Odeh has observed during the activity sessions she runs for children at the Freedom Theatre in the West Bank’s Jenin camp is that their play often turns violent. She identifies strongly with the need that children have to heal from trauma through art and play. One day, the kids are having fun with an activity in the Freedom Theatre, says Odeh, and the next, there is an armed raid by Israeli forces on the camp – an event which has become far more frequent since the start of Israel’s war on Gaza on October 7. With her theatre, she hoped to offer children a space for healing and to empower women through the theatre and arts. In 2006, Juliano Mer-Khamis, Arna’s son by her Palestinian Christian husband, Saliba Khamis, reopened the theatre on a new site in Jenin, doubling as a community centre. During the night, many children were trapped inside schools in the camp, waiting for the incursion to end so they could be reunited with their families. Children in Jenin have been traumatised by the increasing number of armed raids on the camp by Israeli forces since October 7 [Mauricio Morales/Al Jazeera] Resistance through art Given the likelihood of armed incursions, therefore, the theatre staff begin each day trying to find out if there is going to be an attack on the camp; Sheta says he needs to know if his audience, his four children – two boys and two girls – his staff and their families will be safe. He believes there are many ways to contribute to Palestinian resistance to the Israeli occupation – armed struggle is just one.

More are expected to be let go, as the Israeli prime minister’s office said it had received a list of captives to be released on Saturday. Friday also saw the release of 39 Palestinian women and children who had been detained by Israel, some of them for years. During the four days of the pause, at least 50 people are expected to be freed by Hamas, leaving an estimated 190 captives in Gaza.

# Hamas releases 13 Israeli captives after hours-long delay, Qatar confirms

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/25/hamas-releases-thirteen-israeli-captives-after-hours-long-delay-qatar-confirms
<blockquote>
Hamas has handed over 13 Israeli captives and four foreign nationals to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) after a delay of several hours as the group claimed that Israel had violated the terms of a truce. Israel is now expected to release 39 Palestinian prisoners from its jails. Hamas spokesperson Osama Hamdan had said earlier that the aid deliveries permitted by Israel had fallen short of what had been promised and were not reaching northern Gaza, which was the target of Israel’s offensive. Yet, at least two Palestinians were reported to have been killed by the Israeli military and 11 wounded as they attempted the trip to northern Gaza on Friday. Before the snag in the latest hostages-to-prisoners exchange, Egypt, which controls the Rafah border crossing through which aid supplies have resumed into southern Gaza, said it had received “positive signals” from all parties over a possible extension to the pause in fighting. For now, 50 of about 240 hostages are to be exchanged for 150 Palestinian prisoners over four days under the truce, the first halt in fighting since Hamas attacked southern Israel on October 7, killing 1,200 people.

# S.Korea urged to respect China's core interests before top diplomats' meeting in Busan

As of press time on Friday, there has been no information on the top diplomats' meeting from China. Lü noted that it is strange to see the South Korean government still insisting on pointing fingers at China's internal affairs and making provocations while Japan has made adjustments to its relations with China, as China and the US are working to stabilize their relations, especially before and after the top leaders' meetings in San Francisco. Moreover, as the Yoon government has taken a one-sided policy to lean toward the US, it has not only made arbitrary accusations against China but also increased its military exercises with the US, worsening the situation in the Korean Peninsula, said Lü, noting that the current tense environment is not conducive to a trilateral summit of top leaders. The expert noted that China, Japan and South Korea are the three locomotives of regional development and their cooperation is not only beneficial to peoples in the three countries but also to regional and global development.

# West, US once again make amateur remarks about PLA Southern Theater Command’s border drills: Global Times editorial

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1302544.shtml
<blockquote>
The Southern Theater Command of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) conducted live-fire drills and training exercises along the Chinese side of the China-Myanmar border from November 25 to 28. Against the backdrop of armed conflicts erupting in multiple areas in northern Myanmar and their spillover effects, the drills have attracted attention from various parties, especially some Western media outlets. In fact, safeguarding border peace and tranquility is one of the PLA's duties and missions, and similar exercises have been conducted before. For example, in 2017, when the conflict escalated in northern Myanmar and stray bullets even fell on our side, the PLA also conducted joint land and air live-fire exercises on the China-Myanmar border. In short, China's principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries has always been consistent, and its resolute attitude in safeguarding national security and regional stability is also very clear. In the situation in Myanmar, China's contribution in promoting peace talks and reconciliation in recent years is evident to all.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/27/families-urge-renewed-quest-for-answers-in-2014-malaysia-airlines-crash
<blockquote>
More than 40 Chinese relatives signed an open letter to Malaysia’s prime minister on Monday, saying it is time for a new hunt for the truth into flight MH370, which disappeared on March 8, 2014, after it took off with 239 passengers and crew on board, heading from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing. “What I want is that Malaysia Airlines gives me the truth. The families of more than 110 other passengers have already reached a settlement and received between 2.5 million and 3 million yuan, the broadcaster said. In 2016, Malaysian officials revealed the pilot had plotted a path over the Indian Ocean on a home flight simulator but stressed this did not prove he deliberately crashed the plane.

<blockquote>
The US military has captured five attackers who seized an Israel-linked cargo ship in the Gulf of Aden amid missile attacks from Houthi-controlled Yemen. The destroyer USS Mason responded on Sunday to an SOS call from a commercial tanker that had been taken over by armed assailants in the Gulf, US Central Command announced. The statement added that two ballistic missiles were fired from Houthi-controlled parts of Yemen in the general direction of the Mason and the Central Park, but landed about 10 nautical miles away from the vessels, resulting in no damage or injuries. Yemen’s government in Aden blamed the country’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels for the attack.

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1302505.shtml
<blockquote>
Schools should not issue any mandatory requirements for student homework during illness, and should treat student health as priority, the Beijing Municipal Education Commission (BMEC) stated on Saturday, as the city entered a period of high incidence of respiratory infections and an increase in the number of children calling in sick. A smooth transition between online and offline teaching should also be ensured, the commission said, stressing that for students who are absent due to illness, the school should communicate promptly with their parents regarding the key topics covered in the student's absence . The school should make student health the priority and not impose mandatory requirements on the assignments during their illness, and it is not recommended to rush or make up for missed assignments during this period. Currently, the top three respiratory diseases in children in Beijing are influenza, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus.

# Diplomatic dash as end of Israel-Gaza truce looms

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/27/biden-hopes-for-extension-of-israel-hamas-truce-as-more-hostages-released
<blockquote>
Israel has said it is prepared to pause its onslaught on the enclave by one day in exchange for the release of 10 additional captives, although it has also reiterated its intention to continue fighting until “victory”. US President Joe Biden said on Sunday that he hoped the temporary truce between Israel and Hamas could continue as long as captives were being released. However, he said he also told the US leader that, at the end of the truce, Israel would return with full force to achieve its goals for the elimination of Hamas and the release of all captives. Hamas said it had handed over 13 Israelis, three Thais and one with Russian citizenship in the fourth phase of the truce deal exchanges between the two sides. Biden said that he believed “all the players in the region are looking for a way to end this so the hostages are all released and … Hamas is completely no longer in control of Gaza”. “The pause should be extended to make it sustainable and long-lasting while working for a political solution,” he said on Monday at the start of a meeting of the intergovernmental organisation Union for the Mediterranean, at which Israel was absent. NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said that an extension of the truce “would allow for much-needed relief to the people of Gaza and the release of more hostages”.

# Israel-Palestine conflict: A brief history in maps and charts

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/27/palestine-and-israel-brief-history-maps-and-charts
<blockquote>
The Israeli-Palestinian issue goes back nearly a century when Britain, during World War I, pledged to establish a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine under the Balfour Declaration. Between 1918 and 1947, the Jewish population in Palestine increased from 6 percent to 33 percent. In 1947, the UN adopted Resolution 181, which called for the partition of Palestine into Arab and Jewish states, handing over about 55 percent of the land to Jews. The city is currently divided between West Jerusalem, which is predominantly Jewish, and East Jerusalem with a majority Palestinian population. A second agreement in 1995 divided the occupied West Bank into three parts – Area A, B and C. The Palestinian Authority, which was created in the wake of the Oslo Accords, was offered only limited rule on 18 percent of the land as Israel effectively continued to control the West Bank. Israeli settlements and checkpoints About three million Palestinians live in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. Blockade of Gaza This makes up about half of their total population.

Some White House advisors appealed to the president to “cut a line about Hamas beheading babies because those reports were unverified”, according to a report by The Washington Post.

# Analysis: Less than a day left on the Gaza pause, what are the prospects?

<blockquote>
list 4 of 4 Analysis: How Israel could gain from a pause in the Gaza war end of list At one point on Saturday, it looked like fresh celebrations might have to be postponed – Hamas announced that it would not release the second batch of captives because Israel was not respecting the truce deal. In a couple of hours, assurances acceptable to Hamas that the agreed number of aid trucks would get to Gaza before the truce expires on Tuesday morning were issued, and the captives were released late in the evening, the Palestinian detainees minutes later. The celebrations repeated on Sunday. So strong is the desire for a feeble, limited pause to become a more lasting cessation of hostilities, that any inconvenience that could mar it is pushed aside, minimised or ignored. Advertisement Sign up for Al Jazeera Week in the Middle East Catch up on our coverage of the region, all in one place. Tehran’s message was clear, and the minister repeated it to the media: If the then-tentative truce is not observed, “the scope of the war will expand”. After three days of quiet and captives from both sides coming home, we should remind ourselves that this almost idyllical respite is only scheduled to last until Tuesday and that in less than 24 hours, explosions will again rock the Gaza Strip and more people, civilians and soldiers, will be killed. In the absence of an official extension, it is very likely that fighting might resume on Monday night after the last batches of hostages are out and the last aid trucks are in. The only way to prevent the unravelling of the truce is to announce its extension before the last captives are freed on Monday.

# Another Roma boy dies in police chase, marking grim pattern in Greece

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/27/death-of-another-roma-boy-in-greece
<blockquote>
Michalopoulos died with a bullet lodged in his clavicle after being pursued by officers, marking the third time in less than three years that a Roma teenager has been killed in incidents involving Greek police. “He was crazy for his car, with his music, driving around, with all of this. He said he and his friends face regular harassment from the police. They signalled it to stop, a warning that they say was ignored. The lawyer acting for the police officer who was allegedly involved has stated that it appears the teenager attempted to snatch the gun. In his testimony, the police officer, reportedly said: “I was shouting for him to open the door, so we could check on him, I had taken out my pistol because I didn’t know who was inside the vehicle and if he carried a weapon. The victim’s brother countered this in an interview with Greek television channel OPEN, claiming the officer hit the window of the car with the gun, pulled Michalopoulos out of the vehicle, kicked him, and then shot him. A few days after the incident, a CCTV video that was filmed near the scene of the killing was released, in which the exchange between the police and the teenagers can be heard. He alleged that police washed the site of the incident, that police transported and cleaned the vehicle driven by the 17-year-old, and that they wiped the deceased boy’s hands. Alleged police killings of Greek Roma teenagers But here in Thebes we are all fully integrated,” Apostolis Michalopoulos, Christos’s cousin, told Al Jazeera. A squad of Greek police officers on motorbikes chased the car he was riding in, in Perama, and fired at least 36 bullets into the vehicle. Kostas Frangoulis, 16, was shot by police on December 5, 2022, in Thessaloniki after police chased the boy in his car after he allegedly stole gasoline worth 20 euros ($22). “There have been three fatal shootings of Romani teenagers in Greece in three years, and while that number is alarming on its own, Roma across Europe are unfortunately very familiar with racist and violent policing,” said Johnathan Lee, an activist and spokesman at the European Roma Rights Centre.

# The beginning of the end? The hypothetical future of Palestinian politics

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/28/the-beginning-of-the-end-the-hypothetical-future-of-palestinian-politics
<blockquote>
The Palestinians split into the occupied West Bank, partially governed by the PA, and Gaza under Hamas. Israel’s stated objective for its current bombardment and ground offensive in the Gaza Strip in retaliation for Hamas’s surprise attacks on October 7 in southern Israel has been to take out the armed group. But will it return? Advertisement Sign up for Al Jazeera Week in the Middle East Catch up on our coverage of the region, all in one place. Can it return to Gaza? The PA’s support base in the West Bank is based on a transactional relationship with Israel, the analyst said. Israel will be unwilling to relinquish control of the lands it occupies, he added, and it will not be able to take out Hamas as it says it wants to. They can’t eliminate Hamas,” he told Al Jazeera, adding that they’re not just a political wing. Hamas will remain, and what comes after Hamas will also be Hamas,” said al-Rasheq, adding that Palestinians would not accept “the US or Israel or anyone else” telling them who should govern them. Because it is impossible to eradicate Hamas, Jabari said, the group will have to be involved in any post-war negotiations. The PA’s government in the West Bank is seen by many Palestinians as collusion with Israel. PA security practices in the occupied West Bank have also been criticised as heavy-handed but, Nazzal said, the PA needs to “restore order and protect the law”. “Much of the Gaza population now realises that Hamas is going to keep dragging them into a war with Israel, and they don’t want that,” he said. Meanwhile, the Fatah movement, he added, is opposed to a future in which Hamas is taken out.“We do not agree on the Israeli military objectives in Gaza, nor can we predict what will be the outcome of this terrible assault that Israel has launched against our people,” Nazzal said. The US is still ramping up its push for the return of the PA in Gaza, though, and the reasons President Joe Biden’s administration has for this strategy is multifold, Hamayel said. It failed on the battlefield on October 7 when faced with the Qassam Brigades, and it is failing now because it is unable to achieve any real goals in Gaza.”

# Milei improving relations with the US doesn't have to antagonize others: Global Times editorial

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1302604.shtml
<blockquote>
However, it is essential to recognize the severity of the challenges currently faced by Argentina, the second-largest economy in South America: an inflation rate soaring to over 140 percent, the official exchange rate of the peso against the US dollar falling below 350:1, and the central bank's net reserves plunging to more than a negative $10 billion. Four out of every 10 people in Argentina live below the poverty line, and more than half of the population requires some form of social assistance or support. Although Milei's team emphasizes that this visit is "not seeking financing," it is evident that Milei hopes to alleviate Argentina's economic difficulties by strengthening ties with the US. If the US can indeed provide assistance to Argentina, helping it to recover economically and allowing the people to enjoy more well-being, this is something that the international community, including China, is pleased to see. For example, in the 1990s, Argentina's Menem government attempted to fully open the country's financial system to the US, but this effort failed to result in genuine assistance from the US. Milei hopes to have a good relationship with the US, but it should not and must not be based on the premise of antagonizing other countries. This is not helping Argentina, but harming it. In the process of overcoming Argentina's difficulties, the logic and interests of the Milei team and the Argentine people in developing relations with countries like China and Brazil are aligned.

# Industrial profits up for 3rd month as stimulus moves sustain recovery

From January to October, the profits of the equipment manufacturing industry increased by 1.1 percent year-on-year, up 8.9 percentage points compared with the growth rate of the whole industrial sector on average.

In October, the profits of consumer goods manufacturers rose 2.2 percent from a year earlier, up for a third consecutive month.

# US potential intermediate-range missiles deployment ‘big provocation’ to China

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1302569.shtml
<blockquote>
The US military is reportedly planning to deploy new land-based intermediate-range missiles in the Asia-Pacific region to "defend" the island of Taiwan, a move that "has limited tactical impact" at present but fully demonstrates the US' determination to interfere in the Taiwan question, observers said on Monday. Flynn said the US has tested these missiles and plans to deploy them in 2024. The missile the US plans to deploy in the Asia-Pacific is not as powerful as those in Cuba, but despite the difference in the severity of provocations, the two matters are similar in nature, analysts said. Given the risk of a China-US military conflict over the Taiwan question, the US is eyeing ballistic missiles to contain China's possible operations.

# Missing in action: How Eritrean football was deflated at home and abroad

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/28/missing-in-action-how-eritrean-football-was-deflated-at-home-and-abroad
<blockquote>
That is also the case this time, says Daniel Solomon, a former Eritrean national team scout living abroad. “It’s because of [the likelihood] of defections after away matches,” explains Daniel, who is also the founder of the Eritrean Football website. For years, hundreds of thousands of Eritreans have trekked across their country’s borders to avoid the draft, an often risky endeavour in a country where border guards once operated with a “shoot to kill” policy for escapees. “There is no better opportunity [to leave] than this one for young Eritreans who are destined to live in a country where they have duties to perform, but no rights,” Saba explains. Girma Asmerom, Eritrea’s former permanent representative to the UN, played a starring role as a forward for the Ethiopian team that made it to the semifinals of the 1968 AFCON. Other Eritrean football teams have also suffered losses: its local teams no longer play in the CAF African Champions League after multiple defections during away games; in 2021, five members of the Eritrean U-20 female team did not return from a regional qualification game in Uganda. “In other countries, being a full international is a privilege, but not in Eritrea,” says one former player, who absconded during the 2010s and now lives in Europe. He was one of two Europe-based footballers who agreed to speak to Al Jazeera, but only on the condition of anonymity as he still has family in Eritrea. Years after being resettled, both players described living in fear of an Eritrean government that has previously accused players who defect during competitions, of “betraying” their country. Both players said it was heartbreaking that the national team was withdrawn from the World Cup qualifiers.

# Israel arrests almost as many Palestinians as it has released during truce

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/28/arrests
<blockquote>
Ramallah, occupied West Bank – Israel has persisted with arresting dozens of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem as it conducts a prisoner release with Hamas, the Gaza-based armed group. Over the same four days, Israel arrested at least 133 Palestinians from East Jerusalem and the West Bank, according to Palestinian prisoner associations. On Monday, the original four-day truce was extended for another two days, during which an additional 60 Palestinians and 20 captives are expected to be released. In the first two weeks after October 7, Israel doubled the number of Palestinians in its custody from 5,200 people to more than 10,000. The majority of those freed are usually rearrested by Israeli forces in the days, weeks, months and years after their release. Many of the women and children released during the truce have testified to the abuse they experienced in Israeli prisons. In addition to severe beatings, Israeli prison authorities halted medical attention for Palestinian prisoners for at least the first week after October 7, including for those who had been beaten, according to rights groups.

<blockquote>
A Virgin Atlantic passenger jet flying from London to New York powered by 100 percent sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) took off on Tuesday, with the aviation world closely monitoring the flight.

# Jailed without charge: How Israel holds thousands of Palestinian prisoners

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/29/jailed-without-charge-how-israel-holds-thousands-of-palestinian-prisoners
<blockquote>
Here’s a look at the treatment of Palestinian prisoners, how Israel has weaponised administrative detention and why many Palestinians are forced to go through Israeli military courts. The vast majority of the Palestinians – 233 prisoners out of the 300 – on Israel’s release list have not been formally charged and were held as administrative detainees. Almost three-quarters of them are from the occupied West Bank, which has seen a surge of arrests since the start of Israel’s war on Gaza on October 7. Advertisement Sign up for Al Jazeera Week in the Middle East Catch up on our coverage of the region, all in one place. During that time, which could span years, the prisoners, their families and their lawyers may remain in the dark as to what the prisoner has been charged with and what evidence there is against them. A considerable number of them are believed to be administrative detainees. How does the Israeli military judicial system work in the occupied territories? The PA has faced criticism for its security coordination with Israel, under which it is obliged to share information regarding armed Palestinian groups. The rights group Save the Children said in a report in July that 86 percent of children are beaten in Israeli detention, 69 percent are strip-searched and 42 percent are injured during their arrests. Palestinian children are “the only children in the world who are systematically prosecuted in military courts” and an estimated 10,000 have been held in the Israeli military detention system over the past 20 years, according to the group.

# Elon Musk’s Israel trip: What was the purpose, what did he tell Netanyahu?

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/28/elon-musks-israel-trip-what-was-the-purpose-what-did-he-tell-netanyahu
<blockquote>
Billionaire tycoon Elon Musk, who has been accused of platforming anti-Semitic content on his social media platform X, on Monday met Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu during his visit to Israel. Musk was said to have backed Israel’s war on Gaza after the trip that came during the truce between Hamas and Israel. Musk’s visit to Israel, which came amid a truce between Hamas and Israel, follows backlash against a post on X that many have labelled as anti-Semitic, triggering a wave of advertisement withdrawals from the platform by corporate giants such as Apple and IBM, potentially costing X millions of dollars. X has sued Media Matters after accusing the media watchdog of manipulating an algorithm to drive away advertisers. In the brief life-streamed conversation on X, Musk and Netanyahu agreed that Hamas needs to be eradicated – a mission that Israel has used as justification for its military offensive that has claimed overwhelmingly civilian lives. Israeli President Isaac Herzog told Musk during a meeting that he had a huge role to play in the global fight against anti-Semitism. On the X space, Netanyahu said that Musk’s visit to Israel points to his solidarity with Israel. Musk’s visit to Israel is being criticised by some supporters of Israel and Palestine.

# Intensive talks under way to extend Israel-Hamas truce as deadline looms

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/29/efforts-under-way-to-extend-israel-hamas-truce-for-second-time
<blockquote>
The crunch talks continued on Wednesday – the final day of a two-day extension of a truce in the Gaza war – over conditions to extend the deal, which is set to end early on Thursday. “The consensus now is that the truce will be extended” for another few days, said Al Jazeera’s Hashem Ahelbarra. “The danger is that if this … truce expires, that we will return to the killing at the scale that we have seen, which is unbearable,” he told reporters at UN headquarters. >Israel had previously said it was willing to extend the truce by one day for every 10 captives freed by Hamas, and an Israeli official told the Reuters news agency on Wednesday that Israel believes Hamas has enough women and children held captive to extend the current truce by an additional two to three days. The US, which has provided staunch support for Israel throughout the war, has outlined a series of “red lines” for Israel, Bishara explained, including no Israeli “reoccupation” of Gaza, no ethnic cleansing in Gaza and no shrinking of the territory of Gaza. Reporting from occupied East Jerusalem, Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan said there were “leaks coming out that there are negotiations between Israel and Hamas to release additional captives and extend the ceasefire” for five days. If successful, the next phase of the truce and captives’ release will reportedly be based around five categories, he said, “Israeli captives; elderly men who are too old to be reservists; female soldiers; reservist soldiers; and then the bodies of Israelis who were killed before or during captivity.”

But as a gay man in Thailand, where the law says that marriage must be between a man and a woman, it is still just a dream for him and his partner of 25 years. Last week the cabinet of the Thai government endorsed a bill that would amend the country’s Civil and Commercial Code to define marriage as between any two “individuals”.

# ‘Military camp’: Palestinian town of Huwara under 55-day Israeli closure

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/29/military-camp-palestinian-town-of-huwwara-under-55-day-israeli-closure
<blockquote>
Nablus, occupied West Bank – There are at least seven Israeli military points and countless heavily armed soldiers on the mere 6km (3.7-mile) stretch of road that runs through the Palestinian town of Huwara. For the past 55 days, the town, which sits south of Nablus city, has been under a suffocating closure imposed by the Israeli army and settlers that residents liken to a prison. Since then, the area has been turned into a ghost town, with life only getting more difficult for the town’s 8,000 residents since October 7, after which Israel killed over 15,000 Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip, the majority of them women and children. At least 700,000 Israeli settlers live in fortified illegal settlements among, and surrounding, Palestinian neighbourhoods, cities and villages in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. Abdelrahman Dmaidi, a 21-year-old journalist from Huwara, said it is now essentially a military zone. “Towns to the southwest of Nablus have to buy from the villages of Einabus and Jamma’in, for example. Huwara and the villages south of Nablus are among the Palestinian towns in the occupied West Bank most affected by Israeli settler attacks. On November 12, Israeli authorities opened a “bypass road” in Huwara – a road built for settlers to bypass driving through Palestinian villages. “The settlers until now are demanding that the main road and our shops remain closed, even though a bypass road was opened for them,” Mohammad, who is distantly related to the journalist Abdelrahman Dmaidi, told Al Jazeera. Everyone is focused on Gaza while Huwara has been suffering for over a year, but no one is talking about it.”

# Israel-Hamas truce: How much aid has entered Gaza?

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/29/israel-hamas-truce-has-it-helped-relieve-gazas-humanitarian-crisis
<blockquote>
After nearly two months of Israeli bombardment of Gaza, the “humanitarian pause” was brokered to allow the release of Israeli captives in exchange for Palestinian prisoners. But while United Nations agencies and groups like the Palestine Red Crescent Society have been able to scale up aid entering the enclave through the Rafah border crossing with Egypt, the temporary increase has been insufficient to meet the now critical needs of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million, nearly 80 percent of which is now displaced. Here’s a breakdown of the aid that Gaza needs, and what it is receiving — even during the truce. Reporting for Al Jazeera from the southern town of Khan Younis, Hind Khoudary said on Tuesday that at least 750 trucks had crossed the Rafah border into Gaza since Friday. However, on Monday, the UN Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) told Al Jazeera that 200 trucks of aid would be needed daily over a period of two months to meet the population’s basic needs. What is the humanitarian situation? As its attacks on the north intensified, the Israeli military forced people to move south, where supplies of food, fuel and water have been scarce. While the south has been dubbed a “safe zone”, the Israeli military had repeatedly attacked Khan Younis prior to the truce.

# Verdict of Hong Kong's largest national security case will be an important precedent: legal experts

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1302705.shtml
<blockquote>
The case entered the trial process in March 2021 and was successively transferred from the district court to the High Court, during which 31 people pleaded guilty and 16 others denied the charges. During the prosecution's closing arguments, it was noted that Article 22 of the National Security Law (NSL) for Hong Kong categorizes illegal acts into two types: those involving "force or the threat of force" and those involving "other unlawful means." "It is the first case under the NSL for Hong Kong and has attracted a lot of international attention," the expert said, noting that the verdict of this case will become an important precedent in Hong Kong's common law system. It will also set an example for national security legal issues potentially in other common law jurisdictions and set some standards and directions for the NSL for Hong Kong.

# Is Modi’s India cosying up to the Taliban?

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/12/1/is-modis-india-cosying-up-to-the-taliban
<blockquote>
Afghanistan’s diplomatic mission in India, led by former ambassador Farid Mamundzay, announced the permanent closure of its embassy in New Delhi, citing “pressure from both the Taliban and the Indian government to relinquish control”. Nearly two months earlier, Mamundzay had said the embassy would have to stop diplomatic services because of a “lack of support” from India, a reduction in personnel and resources, and the mission’s inability to meet the expectations of an estimated 32,000 Afghan nationals in the country. When the Taliban first took power in Kabul in 1996, India swiftly shut down its embassy there and shunned all diplomatic ties with the ultra-conservative group, with its hardline interpretations of Afghan customs and Islamic rules. New Delhi has engaged in conversations with the Taliban, even though it does not formally recognise the movement as the government of Afghanistan. The short answer: While India has not formally launched diplomatic ties with the Taliban, it has also avoided alienating the group since its return to power, in a bid to retain its presence in Afghanistan, analysts have said. A deterioration in ties between the Taliban and Pakistan has helped India’s gambit. After the collapse of the first Taliban regime, India contributed close to $3bn in aid between 2001 and 2021 for projects in Afghanistan. What was certain though was that the Taliban were going to be rehabilitated; in what form or what positions was unclear,” he said, adding that India started reducing its engagement with Ghani’s government. “It is likely the Taliban takeover may have raised concerns that it would lead to higher Pakistani influence in the country that could potentially jeopardise the Indian presence and interest,” she said. It was an eclipse that would fundamentally change India’s approach to Afghans as well as to Afghanistan, say experts. It was funded by the Afghan embassy in New Delhi, which in turn received financial support from the government of India. “It is the only Afghan school that Afghan girls had access to. This is going to create barriers for Afghans to access education in India,” Sharma said. “So what is the message the government is sending out to these communities?” Sharma questioned. But Mamundzay’s embassy was equally biting in its statement: “There are no diplomats from the Afghan Republic remaining in India … The only individuals present in India are diplomats affiliated with the Taliban.” “[India has] not issued a single statement on women being denied education in Afghanistan, or in support of Matiullah Wesa, who studied in India, and regarded it as his home,” he said, referring to the Afghan girls’ education activist who was jailed by the Taliban for seven months before he was released in October. “And that is largely because they want to protect their diplomatic mission in Kabul, have eyes and ears on the ground in Afghanistan. “While there has been a lot of rhetoric on solidarity with the Afghan people, it doesn’t quite square off with the reality on the ground,” he said, adding that he was observing a widespread and increasing disappointment among Afghans towards India.

# A hard, bloody winter awaits Ukrainian and Russian soldiers, say experts

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/30/a-hard-bloody-winter-awaits-ukrainian-and-russian-soldiers-say-experts
<blockquote>
Last month Russia attempted to answer with a new set of offensives in the east – headed towards the cities of Kupiansk, Lyman, Avdiivka and Mariinka. “I think they’re going to try to push through in the winter,” said Krummrich. It will be a disaster. Ukraine’s armed forces estimate 6,260 Russian deaths in the week of November 20-26, an average of almost 1,000 a day – the result of relentless Russian attacks in the east. “Russia became trapped in an attrition war, which has its own logic … it’s a war on autopilot.” When that failed, it rained down some 10,000 missiles on Ukraine’s cities to break the country’s will to fight. Russia’s ability to keep up its stockpiles and to draw on large reserves of manpower has led some observers to suggest that time is on its side. “I keep hearing people say, he’s going to wear out the Ukrainians. That’s not going to happen with a conscript army that doesn’t want to be there,” said Krummrich, who has fought in special operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, and believes Russian soldier morale is breaking down. “I think the secret desire of both is how to get out and who is going to negotiations first,” Grivas said. But is it likely to happen this winter? Its victory would be a catastrophe, because it is being isolated from the rest of Europe, a big blow to its existential core,” said Grivas.

# How Democrats are alienating their base by blasting a Gaza war ceasefire

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/2/how-democrats-are-alienating-their-base-by-blasting-a-gaza-war-ceasefire
<blockquote>
That schism was prominently on display in November, when activists held a ceasefire protest outside the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington, DC. But advocates say Sherman’s reaction was one of many instances where Democratic politicians have smeared their constituents over the Gaza war, signalling a disconnect with the party’s base. “It’s also a major political error,” Miller told Al Jazeera. She noted that public opinion polls show most Americans — and an overwhelming majority of Democrats — back an end to hostilities in Gaza. “For these members of Congress to not only dismiss it, but to actively attack those people, I think it means that they’re also not reading the political winds of how people will be voting and what they will be demanding in the coming cycle,” Miller said. Usamah Andrabi, communications director at Justice Democrats, a progressive group, said the Democratic Party is showing itself to be “out of step” with its base as well as the broader electorate. Congressional leaders attend a pro-Israel rally in Washington, DC, on November 14 [File: Mark Schiefelbein/AP Photo] Criticising calls for a ceasefire It was unclear which statements she was referring to, but many activists understood her words to be a condemnation of the progressive lawmakers pushing for an end to the war. “What we are seeing is the Biden administration attempting to gaslight the American people into believing that their majority that supports a ceasefire is somehow radical and fringe when the only people who are radical and fringe is the coalition between Netanyahu’s far-right government and the Biden White House,” Andrabi said. And what Democrats are doing is trying to will it into existence that this is not going to matter,” Andrabi explained. But, he added, “it matters so much to so many of their core voting bases”.

# Henry Kissinger: 10 conflicts, countries that define a blood-stained legacy

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/30/henry-kissinger-10-conflicts-countries-that-define-a-blood-stained-legacy
<blockquote>
But to others, Henry Kissinger was a war criminal, whose brutal exercise of realpolitik left a trail of blood around the world – an estimated 3 million bodies in far flung places from Argentina to East Timor. Kissinger won a Nobel Peace Prize for negotiating a ceasefire in Vietnam in 1973. Kissinger’s expansion of the war set the scene for the genocidal rule of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, which seized power from a US-backed military regime and went on to kill a fifth of the population – two million people. Cambodians had been driven into the hands of the communist movement by Kissinger and Nixon’s carpet-bombing campaign, which killed hundreds of thousands of people. In 1974, after a coup by Greece’s ruling military government, Turkish troops moved in. During a visit to Jakarta, Kissinger and Ford told Suharto, a brutal dictator and close ally in the battle against communism, that they understood his reasons, advising him to get it over and done with quickly. His shuttle diplomacy between Egypt, other Arab nations and Israel is often credited with paving the way for the eventual signing of the Camp David Accords in 1978. By then, Kissinger was out of office, but in 1981, he explained that at the heart of his diplomacy in the Middle East was a simple policy objective — to “isolate the Palestinians” from their Arab neighbours and friends. Videla would oversee the disappearance of up to 30,000 opponents. During most of his time in the Nixon and Ford administrations, Kissinger didn’t appear to have given Africa much thought. China, he said, needed the US, and the US needed China.

# Analysis: Why Israel’s military wanted to end the Gaza truce, and what now?

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/1/analysis-why-israels-military-wanted-to-end-the-gaza-truce-and-what-now
<blockquote>
The Israeli military has long been advocating for the continuation of war. It can be assumed that Gallant represents and voices the policy of the Israeli cabinet towards Gaza much more accurately and precisely than his troubled and embattled prime minister, who is increasingly merely trying to secure his political survival. The writing on the wall is that Israel will finally rid itself of Netanyahu as soon as the war is over. Although he was not personally involved in negotiations, as a member of the inner circle of decision-makers, he was certainly aware of all the difficulties in negotiating additional respite from fighting. He also announced a further stage in fighting, saying that Israel would fight “in the whole Strip”. That means the south is now so overcrowded that there is a danger that an all-out ground assault from Israel might leave the people of Gaza with no option but to try to force their way across the border fence into Egypt.

# Israeli air strikes pound Gaza as truce with Hamas ends

<blockquote>
Israeli air strikes have been reported across the enclave, including the south, which was previously said to be safe for fleeing civilians. “Hamas violated the operational pause, and in addition, fired toward Israeli territory,” the Israeli army said in a post on X on Friday. “With the resumption of fighting we emphasise: The Israeli government is committed to achieving the goals of the war – to free our hostages, to eliminate Hamas, and to ensure that Gaza will never pose a threat to the residents of Israel,” Netanyahu’s office said. There are now reports of heavy gunfire and Israeli shelling in the north, central and southern parts of Gaza, Al Jazeera’s journalists in the enclave reported, saying aircraft and drones could be heard overhead. “The Gaza Strip is under heavy artillery and even aerial bombardment by the [Israeli] occupation forces,” said Al Jazeera’s Tareq Abu Azzoum, reporting from Khan Younis in southern Gaza. The evacuation warnings suggest Israel is now planning to further target areas in the south of the Strip after concentrating most of its bombardment on the north of the enclave in the weeks before the truce.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/1/the-israel-hamas-truce-has-ended-what-we-know-so-far
<blockquote>
“We have seen rockets being fired from Gaza before that have been intercepted by the Iron Dome that Hamas later said were simply a misfire,” reported Al Jazeera’s Imran Khan from East Jerusalem. Minutes after, Israeli air raids and artillery fighting resumed in Gaza and witnesses in the enclave reported heavy clashes between Israeli forces and Palestinian fighting groups. At least 54 people have been killed since Israel’s army resumed its attacks, according to Gaza’s health ministry. There are reports that a house has also been destroyed in Rafah in the south of Gaza. Also in central Gaza, 10 people have been killed and a number of civilians have been wounded in the Maghazi area. Due to Israeli bombardment and clashes that began after the October 7 Hamas attack, about 60 percent of homes in Gaza have been destroyed, reported Gaza’s government media office. He called the US a decision-maker in this war, adding, “This war from the beginning has been America’s war against the Palestinian people,” on Telegram. What about captives and Palestinian prisoners ? Of the 350 prisoners, 240 have been released and 110 remain. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said that with the resumption of fighting, Israel was committed to achieving its targets in the war. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Qatar released a statement on Friday, expressing “deep regret at the resumption of the Israeli aggression against Gaza”.

# ‘Save what remains of Gaza’, hospital director says after Israel bombing

I wished I had been martyred with my family instead of the suffering and pain I am experiencing now.” It is also a place of shelter for displaced people, despite the lack of provisions. We have no shelter,” she says. In a conversation with Al Jazeera, the director of the European Gaza Hospital, Dr Youssef al-Aqqad, says that displaced people – who come from all over the Gaza Strip – are having to find space wherever they can in the hospital: at the doors of patient rooms, in the corridors, on the stairs, and in the hospital garden. At least 26 out of the 35 hospitals in the Gaza Strip are not functioning due to the lack of fuel and attacks by the Israeli army. In the northern Gaza Strip, the Indonesian Hospital has been bombed repeatedly by the Israeli army, which also ordered the evacuation of doctors and the wounded. This forced the Ministry of Health in Gaza to distribute the injured to hospitals in the central and southern Gaza Strip, including the European Gaza Hospital.

The Israeli Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development has said 30,000 to 40,000 workers have left the country’s farms since the October 7 attacks by Hamas on southern Israel. Consequently, it has been on the hunt for up to 5,000 workers from elsewhere, including from its loyal ally Malawi. As many as 30,000 of them were employed on farms in the country at the time of the Hamas attack. After the war began, Chakwera called for a “cessation of violence by all parties” and the end to military action against known civilian targets in Gaza.

# Blinken urges Israel to protect civilians amid tough Gaza truce talks

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/30/blinken-pledges-support-for-israel-as-gaza-truce-extend-for-third-time
<blockquote>
US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has told Israel that it must account for the safety of Palestinian civilians before resuming any military operation in Gaza, where a week-long truce has allowed the exchange of captives held by Hamas for Palestinians imprisoned in Israel. His message was in keeping with the administration of US President Joe Biden’s shifting rhetoric on the war, which began as a full-throated embrace of Israel’s response to the Hamas attacks but gradually tempered as the number of Palestinian civilian casualties began to rise dramatically. As Israel bombarded hospitals, schools and homes, the Gaza Ministry of Health said at least 7,000 people are still missing or feared buried under the rubble, and more than 36,000 Palestinians have been wounded, many with life-altering injuries. In his meeting with Abbas, Blinken focused on efforts to increase the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza and condemned Jewish settler attacks against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. Blinken told Abbas “he would continue to insist on full accountability for those responsible,” and that Washington “remains committed to advancing tangible steps for a Palestinian state,” the State Department said. At least 248 Palestinians, including more than 50 children, have been killed in the occupied West Bank since October 7. Blinken’s meetings came as Israel and Hamas agreed at the last minute to a third extension of a truce under which Israel has paused most military activity in return for the release of captives held by Hamas.

# UN’s top court bars Venezuela from action in Guyana border dispute

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/1/uns-top-court-bars-venezuela-from-action-in-guyana-border-dispute
<blockquote>
The International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Friday told the Latin American country to “refrain from taking any action which would modify that situation that currently prevails” in the Essequibo region that makes up some two-thirds of Guyana. However, judges made it clear that any concrete action to alter the status quo should be stopped, and the legally binding ruling remains in place until a case brought by Guyana against Venezuela on the future of the region is considered by the court. Also on the ballot is whether Caracas should reject ICJ jurisdiction over the dispute, and whether or not to grant Venezuelan citizenship to the people – currently Guyanese – of a new “Guyana Esequiba State”. The dispute has intensified since ExxonMobil’s 2015 discovery of crude in Essequibo.

The decision, first reported by the news website Semafor on Thursday, came amid what advocates describe as a crackdown on criticism against Israel in the media, at universities and in the arts. “As a strong supporter of free speech, MSNBC owes the public an explanation for this decision,” Khanna wrote in a social media post.

# Beijing reports surprising sightings of auroras, second time in history

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202312/1302891.shtml
<blockquote>
On Friday night, the auroras appeared in many high-latitude areas of China, including Northeast China's Heilongjiang and North China's Inner Mongolia. Due to the relatively low geomagnetic latitude in China, even when there is strong geomagnetic activity, it is difficult to observe obvious aurora phenomena, according to China Weather Network on Friday night. According to reports, the observation of auroras in many northern regions of China this time was due to geomagnetic storm activity. Therefore, it is possible to see auroras in Beijing, which is located at a latitude of 40 degrees, said Zhu Jin, a researcher at the Beijing Planetarium and editor-in-chief of the magazine Amateur Astronomer, as reported by Red Star News on Friday.

# ‘We will never forget’: Reliving the pain of the Nakba amid Israel’s war

<blockquote>
Abdullah brought his wife and children to Baqaa in 1967. A family photo of Abdullah and Fatima Nashwan [Hanna Davis/Al Jazeera] Abdullah’s 57-year-old son, Saadi, Mohammad’s father, grew up in Baqaa. Saadi and five of his siblings were born in a refugee camp in Jericho, where his parents had fled as children with their own parents during the Nakba of 1948, when an estimated 750,000 Palestinians were forced to leave their homes and land during the creation of Israel. The bottom one shows five of Abdullah’s children when they were young [Hanna Davis/Al Jazeera] The ‘Nakba’ Abdullah arrived in the Jericho refugee camp as a child of 11 and lived there for more than 20 years, growing into adolescence, getting married and having six children with his wife. He had walked 50km (31 miles) with his family to get there from Dawaymeh in 1948. When the mukhtar returned to the village to check on them, he found the bodies of about 60 men, women and children in the mosque and the bodies of 85 more in the cave. Abdullah’s family was among those who fled. With more than 70 percent of Gaza’s 2.3 million people displaced by Israel’s attacks, this is the largest mass displacement of Palestinians in 75 years. “We are watching Palestine fall apart,” Saadi says. Growing up, he says, he would sit beside his father and soak up all his stories. “Our homes are Palestinian.

# More than 180 killed as Israel resumes Gaza assault after truce lapses

<blockquote>
More than 180 people have been killed and hundreds of others wounded as Israeli forces resumed their bombardment of the Gaza Strip, according to Palestinian officials, after a week-long truce expired. Hamas said it had targeted Tel Aviv, but there were no reports of casualties or damage there. Marouf called on countries, especially members of the Arab League and the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, to come up with an “urgent rescue plan” and to find “quick humanitarian solutions that address the fate of more than 250,000 families who have lost their homes”. Qatar, which has played a central role in mediation efforts along with the United States and Egypt, said negotiations were still going on with Israelis and Palestinians to restore the truce, but that Israel’s renewed bombardment of Gaza had complicated its efforts. “There has been some disappointment, the fact that the US efforts to extend the ceasefire were not successful, but the other reaction has been to simply repeat the Israeli line that the end of the ceasefire came about because of actions by Hamas,” Al Jazeera’s Mike Hannah reported from Washington, DC. More than 15,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since October 7, including more than 6,000 children.

# Gaza aid trucks stranded as Israel-Hamas war resumes

<blockquote>
Aid was stranded near Egypt’s border with Gaza as Israel resumed its military campaign on Friday, with truck drivers saying they expected further delays to a complex delivery process that had briefly speeded up during a weeklong truce. A spokesperson for the Rafah border crossing confirmed that the entrance of trucks carrying much-needed aid, fuel and cooking gas from Egypt into the Gaza Strip had stopped because of the resumption of the Israeli bombardment. More than 15,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since October 7, Palestinian officials say. Under a system in place since October 21, aid trucks had to drive for inspection to the Al-Awja and Nitzana crossing on Egypt’s border with Israel before returning to Rafah to deliver their cargoes, a round trip of more than 80km (50 miles) that aid workers and Egyptian officials say caused bottlenecks. “All the obstacles are there because they are the ones controlling the movement of goods,” said Gameel Mahmoud Idrees, a driver waiting near the Rafah crossing with a cargo of food supplies, his second delivery of aid since the war began. The truce allowed for about 200 aid trucks to enter Gaza daily, more than double the previous average.

# US says Indian gov’t official directed plot to assassinate Sikh activist

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/29/indian-official-directed-plot-to-assassinate-sikh-activist-on-us-soil-doj
<blockquote>
On Wednesday, federal prosecutors said that Nikhil Gupta, a 52-year-old Indian man, had worked with an Indian government intelligence and security worker in a clandestine effort to kill a Sikh activist in New York. The charges have come a week after a senior member of the administration of President Joe Biden said that the US had thwarted a plot to kill a Sikh separatist in the US, and two months after Canadian authorities accused the Indian government of involvement in the assassination of a Sikh activist in Canada. That official said Gurpatwant Singh Pannun, who says he is a dual citizen of the United States and Canada, was the target of the foiled plot. India has described Sikh separatism as a national security threat, and fought a brutal campaign against armed separatists seeking the establishment of a Sikh state in Punjab, commonly referred to as Khalistan, in the 1980s.

# ‘Serious doubt’ Israel complying with international law: Spain PM Sanchez

<blockquote>
Spain’s prime minister has expressed doubts that Israel is abiding by international law in its war on Gaza, given the high number of civilian casualties there. Israel responded to what it called a “shameful statement” by Sanchez, by summoning the Spanish ambassador for a reprimand and recalling its envoy from Madrid for consultations. Eight weeks of Israeli bombardment and a ground offensive in Gaza have killed at least 15,000 Palestinians, uprooted three-quarters of the population of 2.3 million and sparked a debilitating humanitarian crisis, before a temporary truce was called on November 24. During the truce, Israel has continued to wage deadly raids in the West Bank, while rounding up nearly as many new prisoners as it has released.

# ‘I am not an anti-Semite’: Pro-Palestine artists cancelled across Europe

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/30/art-world-cancels-palestine-solidarity
<blockquote>
They said that among the allegedly anti-Semitic posts were an “uncommented interview by Shahidul Alam with the Palestinian ambassador to Bangladesh, a comparison of the current war with the Holocaust, and accusations of genocide by the state of Israel against the Palestinian population in Gaza”. Israel began bombing Gaza after Hamas, which governs the densely populated Strip, attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 Israelis and kidnapping more than 200. That letter prompted German accusations of anti-Semitism against Hoskote, a writer and curator. The pro-Palestinian post had been published by British artist and activist Hamja Ahsan, who took part in Documenta’s 2022 edition as a solo artist. Earlier this month, several filmmakers withdrew from the world’s leading documentary festival, held in the Netherlands, after organisers criticised a pro-Palestinian protest on opening night during which activists raised a banner on stage reading “From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free”. “This kind of propaganda against Palestinians of being anti-Semitic is the thing that has been used widely against us for a long time,” Alsharif told Al Jazeera of the “river to the sea” slogan, which is deemed a rallying cry by pro-Palestinian protestors, but a call to destroy Israel by supporters of the Jewish state. He told Al Jazeera that his London appearance had been the “biggest event of my book tour”. “This was a time when the atmosphere in the UK was very [politically] hostile to expressions of sympathy for Palestinians,” said Thrall. And if you don’t stand up then it means that anything [you say or do] can be scrutinised if it doesn’t fall under an agenda.”

# Lula faces numerous challenges as Brazil assumes G20 presidency

https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2023/12/1/lula-faces-numerous-challenges-as-brazil-assumes-g20-presidency
<blockquote>
The Group of Twenty – the G20 – is a forum for the world’s largest economies to coordinate on key issues of global policy. At its G20 leadership summit in September, India invited the African Union – representing 55 countries from across the continent – to become a member of the group. Against a backdrop of rising geopolitical tensions, South Africa and Brazil have openly criticised Israel’s bombardment of Gaza. That didn’t stop India from “turning the annual summit into a commercial for the personality cult of Modi,” said Jayati Ghosh, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Ahead of this week’s handover, Lula informed a virtual summit of G20 leaders that “I hope this [Israeli-Palestinian ceasefire] agreement can pave the way for a lasting political solution to the conflict.” Elsewhere, Brazil’s president has irked Western leaders by suggesting that Russia and Ukraine share joint responsibility for their conflict. At the G20 summit in New Delhi in September, President Lula urged leaders to try and end world hunger by 2030. He was alluding to IMF programmes such as the Resilience and Sustainability Trust, where country grants are capped at 150 percent of their capital commitments into the fund. I think that Lula will try and raise country quotas for emergency lending, and attempt to reduce the conditions attached to these programmes,” he added, pointing out that its success was unclear as this had been tried for years,” Studart also dismissed the World Bank’s “cautious” approach to risk tolerance. “The Bank can raise considerably more money for developing countries by adjusting its loan-to-equity ratio,” he said.

# Scrapping of all China sanctions urged after US reportedly plans to drop investment curbs from Defense Bill: observers

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1302725.shtml
<blockquote>
US Congressional negotiators are preparing to drop China investment curbs from the Defense Bill, reports said, showing that restrictions on Chinese industries could mean a heavy price for Americans, observers said, while calling for a scrapping of sanctions on Chinese firms to push forward two-way trade and investment cooperation. It is hoped that the US will translate its promise of "not intending to suppress and contain China" into action and meet China halfway to create good conditions for enterprises to carry out two-way trade and investment cooperation, China's Ministry of Commerce spokesperson Shu Jueting said at a regular press briefing on November 23. Biden noted that a stable and developing China serves the interests of the US and the world.

# Is Israel criminalising Palestinian thoughts too, amid Gaza war?

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/12/2/is-israel-criminalising-palestinian-thoughts-too-amid-gaza-war
<blockquote>
Following the October 7 Hamas attack, Israel has been clamping down on pro-Palestinian sentiment within its borders, including passing an amendment to its counterterrorism law that has been criticised for violating civil and human rights. The amendment will be in effect for two years, with the option to extend and add other groups to the list at a later date. What are the criticisms of the amendment? But Israel’s crackdown on pro-Palestinian sentiment has gone much further. There have been reports of dozens of cases of Palestinian students enrolled in Israeli universities and colleges facing disciplinary action – and sometimes expulsion – over any expression of support for Gaza or raising awareness about Palestinian children being killed by Israeli operations. Lawyers have been warned by the Israeli Bar Association not to publish content online that may be perceived as “incitement to violence”. The overwhelming majority of crackdowns taking place in Israel following the war have been targeted at Arabs, specifically Palestinians, living in Israel. Advertisement What other legal measures affecting Palestinians have been put in place? The Knesset on October 18 approved an amendment to its “prison ordinance” that effectively allows for the overcrowding of prison cells as the Israeli government arrests more Palestinians. Along with other officials, the minister has been a driver of a policy to significantly increase the number of Israeli civilians who are armed.

# ‘My son was killed on October 6. There was no Hamas’

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/12/1/my-son-was-killed-on-october-6-there-was-no-hamas
<blockquote>
Sitting in the living room of her home in the Palestinian town of Huwara, south of Nablus city, Najlaa said: “That was the last time we all celebrated together.” It has come under severe settler attacks and movement restrictions imposed by the Israeli army for more than a year and a half. On the night of October 5 – and into the early hours of October 6 – dozens of Israeli settlers attacked the Dmaidi home which is situated on the Huwara road – the main artery running from the north to the south used by both Palestinians and settlers. “The settlers were gathered in front of our building and snipers standing on rooftops were shooting at people,” Najlaa explained, adding that the “army was with” the settlers and that they were firing tear gas into their home. The father-of-three said he was very proud of his son before he was killed. “Labib would go to university every day, and after that he would work at his uncle’s store in Huwara,” Mohammad told Al Jazeera, adding that his son was also taking a course in home decor. The worsening conditions for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, particularly in Huwara, make it difficult to imagine a better future for Palestinian children, he said. My son was killed on October 6. When they attacked our house yet again two weeks after they killed my son, there was no Hamas,” he said. “Imagine that a minister of a state comes out and says to the media ‘erase Huwara’ – what world are we living in?” It was meant to serve for five years in the lead-up to the creation of an independent Palestinian state in the 1967-occupied territories of East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

# Somalia has joined the EAC regional bloc. What happens next?

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/11/29/somalia-has-joined-the-eac-regional-bloc-what-happens-next
<blockquote>
“We are a significant country in the region which can contribute a lot, and we will also benefit from them,” Mohamud said as he landed in Mogadishu after an EAC summit in Arusha, Tanzania, where Somalia was admitted into the bloc on Friday. However, experts argued that Somalia has taken significant strides in its fight against the armed group al-Shabab and point to security challenges in other EAC members such as the DRC, where at least 120 armed groups are fighting in its volatile east, and South Sudan, which has been in and out of a civil war since before its independence. Its mission has been to foster economic growth by, among other things, eliminating customs duties among member states. It established a common market in 2010. Still, analysts said, Somalia, which has Africa’s longest coastline and an estimated two million citizens in the diaspora, is ripe for economic integration with its neighbours. “We understand that all [those bodies were] formed for political, peace and development cooperation, but the EAC bloc is different and was mainly formed for economic and trade purposes,” Abdishakur, who is also a member of parliament, told Al Jazeera. “It’s an added advantage [to member states] for Somalia to join the bloc, but we are not gaining much.” In a report released this month, the Heritage Institute, a Mogadishu-based think tank, stressed that this could be tough to do and thus hinder Somalia from being an effective member of the EAC. “For the Kenyan side, there was no avenue to resolve the issue, but now after the admission of Somalia to the East African Community, there is hope any future dispute between the two countries can be resolved through the mechanisms of the economic bloc,” said Abdullahi Abdi, an analyst on Horn of Africa affairs. If that leads to the decimation of al-Shabab, which is infamous for its resilience, then Somalia’s admission into the EAC could turn out to be a masterstroke not just for the country but also the region, they said.

It says it is open to a loan request, but must be sure that in such an event it would get the works back. According to a report by the Financial Times,  Starmer, the Labour leader, was planning to tell Mitsotakis that “he will not stand in the way of a mooted loan deal involving part of the Parthenon sculptures being sent to Athens”.

# Analysis: Why extending the Israel-Hamas truce won’t be easy

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/29/analysis-why-extending-the-israel-hamas-truce-wont-be-easy
<blockquote>
Hamas announced that it is seeking a further four-day extension, and even hinted at being ready to negotiate the release of all captives it is holding, in exchange for a more lasting cessation of hostilities. For the past two days, they have been joined in Qatar by the highest officials from the US, Israeli and Egyptian intelligence services. No announcement has been made of the presence of their Hamas counterparts, but it is very hard to imagine that the Palestinian side would not be represented in such an intelligence summit. How is it possible that from overwhelming optimism that marked the weekend mass celebrations of former captives rejoining their communities, the talks are now on the verge of failure with the real prospect of fighting resuming on Thursday? For a couple of days, they lived almost as civilians, but, as the original pause was to expire on Monday, they would have had to return to units by Sunday afternoon – the time when the extension was announced. Military bureaucracy then had to decide whether to give them an extra day or two at home or rotate soldiers, with the eventual new group being granted just two days off and so on. Aware of potential problems with morale and determination, generals obviously prefer to get the fighting over with, rather than endure more of the stop-go-stop-go orders that in all wars prove detrimental to the fighting capabilities of an army.

# US sends ‘bunker buster’ bombs to Israel for war on Gaza, report says

# HKSAR government condemns US Congress for meddling in Hong Kong affairs

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202311/1302775.shtml

The government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) and the Commissioner's Office of China's Foreign Ministry in Hong Kong on Thursday strongly condemned the US House Foreign Affairs Committee for passing the so-called Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office Certification Act, urging the US to stop meddling in Hong Kong affairs. The act aims to achieve political objectives by smearing and attacking the work of Hong Kong ETOs in the US in terms of promoting mutually beneficial economic and trade relations, and cultural exchanges between Hong Kong and the US, and misleadingly promoting the removal of those privileges, exemptions and immunities and even the closure of the ETOs. If the act is implemented, it will jeopardize economic and trade relations between the HKSAR and the US, and will also hurt the US financial industry, leading to gaps in the global system of the US financial sector, as Hong Kong is an internationally renowned financial center, He said.

# The South Korean woman who adopted her best friend

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/12/2/the-south-korean-woman-who-adopted-her-best-friend
<blockquote>
Seoul, South Korea – Most mornings, Eun Seo-Ran begins her day at around 7am by brewing tea for herself and her adopted daughter Lee Eo-Rie*. Despite being her adopted daughter, Eo-Rie is 38 – just five years younger than 43-year-old Seo-Ran. The story of how Seo-Ran and Eo-Rie became family represents this desire to challenge—and reimagine—what it means to be family in South Korea. Sign up for Al Jazeera Week in the Middle East Catch up on our coverage of the region, all in one place. “Don’t live like me,” she would say. I have wanderlust, I love to travel spontaneously, and I don’t like children,” she says shrugging. In a country where many single people live with their parents, young women living alone are often vulnerable, stereotyped as being sexually available and 11 times more likely than men to experience break-ins. Soon, they were sharing dinner every night. “But more than anything else … Eo-Rie and I talked a lot about how to live well and happily in old age, and concluded that living with a like-minded friend would be one of the best ways to do so,” Seo-Ran explains. “I came to believe that a real family is those who share their lives while respecting and being loyal to each other, whether or not they are related by blood or marriage,” says Seo-Ran. And even if we are, we wouldn’t be able to marry since same-sex marriage is not legal in South Korea,” Seo-Ran explains. “But none of that is possible in South Korea unless we are a legal family. Although both Seo-Ran and Eo-Rie’s families have accepted their lifestyle, and the women jointly own their home, they wanted equal legal protection and rights. But the number of South Koreans exploring – and endorsing – lifestyles outside the conventional family unit is growing. Min-Ji began her podcast—based on the Korean words “bihon (no marriage, or, willingly unmarried)” and “sesang (world)” with a nod to Beyonce and her song, Single Ladies – from her living room in 2020, bored with isolation during the pandemic and hoping to reach out to other women like her. “In a world that seems to scream that getting married is the only right answer, and that it’s unseemly to be a single woman unless you’re rich and successful, I wanted to show that there are many single women out there living mundane, ordinary lives—and that it’s perfectly okay!” Some of them are in a relationship, and some listen to my podcast with their boyfriends,” Min-Ji says. “My podcast has become a platform where no-marriage women can connect with others like them and do things together,” explains Min-Ji, stroking the head of her only full-time companion – a small rescue dog – sitting next to her on a sofa. But, like Seo-Ran, Min-Ji and her single friends face a key question: Who will care for them when they grow old or get sick? By 2050, more than 40 percent of the population is projected to be older than 65, and by 2070, nearly half of the population will be elderly. Promoted under the slogan “the right to not be lonely”, the law would benefit friends or couples living together including oft-neglected elderly people who are divorced, widowed, or estranged from their children, and people who live alone, Yong told me from her office in Seoul. The vast majority of them were men in their 50s and 60s. Salim, a grassroots social and healthcare cooperative founded by dozens of feminists in Seoul in 2012, is one of them. Eunpyeong is home to many NGOs, women’s rights groups, and social enterprises and has been endorsed by Min-Ji’s podcast as one of the best neighbourhoods for single women due to its vibrant community. By 2050, more than 40 percent of the country’s population is projected to be older than 65 [File: Carl Court/Getty Images] Snapshots of the future She says she shared her story to help people like her who don’t want to marry but might want to know how to form a family. For a long time, Seo-Ran’s mother wanted her daughter to marry, worried she’d be left alone after she died. But now she says she’s relieved that Seo-Ran is happy and has formed her own family. “You two don’t need to care at all about what the world and others say,” she told her daughter. “Just live your life fully.”

# Trial of Hong Kong activists under China-imposed law enters home straight

Hong Kong’s largest-ever state security trial has entered its closing phase, with pro-democracy activists linked to massive street protests in 2019 charged under a contentious China-imposed national security law (NSL). The defendants are among 47 opposition activists, including elected lawmakers, unionists, and academics, who were rounded up by police in 2021, accused of plotting to sew a constitutional crisis and subvert the government. Throughout a 100-day trial, prosecutors have outlined what they say was a plan by the activists to subvert the government. In October, a group of United Nations human rights experts said they were troubled by “the use of mass trials in NSL cases”, warning they could “negatively affect safeguards that ensure due process and the right to fair trial”. Those who have pleaded guilty include former law professor Benny Tai and activist Joshua Wong, who will be sentenced after the trial.

# ‘Diamonds are in my blood’: The Jain jewellery traders of Antwerp

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/12/2/diamonds-are-in-my-blood-the-jain-jewellery-traders-of-antwerp
<blockquote>
“It all depends on business conditions, and Antwerp is the diamond business hub. Here they found that the government, the facilities are favourable for business. Jains dominate Antwerp’s diamond industry, the most lucrative and influential in the world, having slowly taken over from the Orthodox Jewish community over the past 60 years. Advertisement Sign up for Al Jazeera Week in the Middle East Catch up on our coverage of the region, all in one place. “That’s why Jains are into trading, not manufacturing,” says Akash. “Jain diamond firms have done a lot of work looking at the source of their diamonds and for anything in the supply line which may be unethical,” says Vekemans. They were influential in the development and application of the Kimberley Process; India, where the diamond trade is also dominated by Jains, was one of the founding members of this international certification scheme which aims to eradicate conflict diamonds from the industry. At the centre of it all is Antwerp’s diamond exchange, where Tom Neys, a representative of the Antwerp World Diamond Centre, which oversees the city’s diamond trade, works. That all changed in the 1960s, when Jain traders from Gujarat began buying small, rough diamonds at a low price, outsourcing cutting and polishing to craftspeople back in Gujarat, and then selling them in Antwerp. “Today, 95 percent of the diamonds sold here are cut and polished in India,” he says. The Jain and Jewish communities in Antwerp are well-suited to the diamond trade for the same reasons: they’re small, close-knit and built on trust. In an industry based on trust, outsiders are viewed with suspicion; this is a closed club. “Trust – that’s the main part of the diamond business,” he says. If you have good karma, your life will be good.”

# Egypt’s Sinai Bedouins fear Israel’s mass displacement of Gaza Palestinians

As Israel’s war on Gaza nears the end of a second month, Rehab Eldalil worries about reports of efforts by Israel to push the 2.3 million people of the besieged Gaza Strip into the Egyptian Sinai Peninsula – her ancestors’ home. Advertisement Sign up for Al Jazeera Week in the Middle East Catch up on our coverage of the region, all in one place. They know their land so well that it becomes intimidating, and there arises a need to control them.” When Sinai was “discovered” in the late 1980s as a region that could make Egypt a tourism revenue, the Bedouins who lived there did not benefit – in fact, they found themselves displaced and disadvantaged, according to Eldalil. With the mounting security concerns around the Rafah crossing since the hostilities in Gaza started on October 7, local Egyptian authorities seem to have changed their minds. “In October, dozens of people from the Sawarka and Rumailat tribes gathered again […] but members of the armed forces dispersed the gathering and arrested a number of young people.” This is a sentiment shared by Palestinians who already live in Sinai. Bedouins in Sinai, he says, have been helping Palestinians who were stuck in the desert when the current war started, and have been volunteering to provide relief to injured Palestinians coming from Gaza since the partial opening of the Rafah crossing in early November. Now, as fears mount that a forced exodus of people from Gaza into Sinai could, in turn, displace local communities, Eldalil hopes the government will continue to nurture the relationship between Cairo and the Bedouins of Sinai. “There are in fact people inhabiting Sinai: the Bedouin communities,” she says, “who also have the right to remain on their land, just like the Palestinians”.

# Q&A: UN expert on Australia citizenship-stripping plan and ‘legal fiction’

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2023/12/2/qa-un-expert-on-australia-citizenship-stripping-plan-and-legal-fiction
<blockquote>
Australia’s centre-left Labor government introduced the proposed legislation this week after Australia’s High Court recently ruled that previous legislation giving the Minister for Home Affairs the power to revoke citizenship was invalid. Ben Saul: In Australia, the citizenship laws of the previous government relied on a kind of legal fiction that if you committed certain kinds of terrorism that automatically meant that your citizenship lapsed because it was showing disloyalty and lack of allegiance. The second thing the Australian courts and the High Court, in a series of decisions, have said is that the High Court regards stripping citizenship as a criminal-type penalty or punishment. And, under the Australian Constitution, that’s a power which can only be exercised by a court. So, essentially what the courts have said is that the minister can’t take that decision. AJ: How do the Australian court rulings relate to the United Kingdom and, for example, the case of Shamima Begum? In other countries, it’s a decision that can be made by a minister but which is then reviewable by a court. And secondly, it has to be reviewed by a court so there has to be some form of judicial protection in that process. The Australian approach goes one step further and says there has to be the protection of a criminal court decision which is a much more robust way of ensuring there are safeguards in place. The other historical kind of category was cases of treason or treachery, where your country is at war with another country and you do something to assist the enemy, which shows a kind of disloyalty to your own country and those are cases in wartime which have sometimes led to a loss of nationality as well.

According to OCHA, the camps house about 2 million people, and at least 15,000 new tents are needed to each winter, but most of the existing tents have not been replaced for years and do not include the insulation needed to provide protection from the rain and cold.

# Progressive US lawmakers renew calls for ceasefire in Gaza

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/30/progressive-us-lawmakers-renew-calls-for-ceasefire-in-israel-hamas-war
<blockquote>
Tlaib and her colleagues gathered to show support for the hunger strikers and warned that the war in Gaza must end, stressing that a temporary pause in fighting was not sufficient. Tlaib, who is the only Palestinian American member of Congress, hit out at the White House for calling lawmakers who demanded a ceasefire early in the war “repugnant”. The refusal to support a ceasefire and an end to violence and the killing is repugnant and disgraceful. They feel our energy in the White House. Now more than 40 lawmakers in the House and the Senate have called for a ceasefire in Gaza. Biden sparked speculations on Tuesday with a social media post that could be interpreted as a call for Israel to wind down the war, suggesting that the violence would only boost support for Hamas. The war on Gaza began on October 7 after Hamas launched an attack on southern Israel that killed 1,200 Israelis and saw more than 200 people taken as captives. The war has displaced more than one million Palestinians inside Gaza. Last week, an agreement, brokered by Qatar, the US and Egypt, was reached to temporarily halt the fighting to allow for the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas in exchange for Palestinian prisoners and the ramping up of humanitarian aid into Gaza.

# Smoked bacon custom stays amid pursuit of fresh air

Instead of using personal facilities to smoke the meat, local residents are required to go to designated spots to have the meat produced. As the traditional method of preparing the bacon may have an impact on the environment, there is a need to address the issue while preserving this delicacy. The apology reflected the government's recognition of the custom of smoking bacon and its determination to rectify a one-size-fits-all regulation designed to curb air pollution at the cost of disrupting local residents' traditions and culture. Some 26 environmentally friendly bacon smoking spots were set up for the public in Yubei in 2016. The recent controversy on smoked bacon has called for a down-to-earth stance and thoughtful approach in addressing people's concerns.

The accusations that Mekorot has contributed to the oppression of Palestinians have prompted some groups to sever ties with the Israeli water company over the past decade. And in 2014, the Argentinian province of Buenos Aires scrapped a deal with the company to build a desalination plant after public protests.

# What is Africa’s goal at COP28 as the climate summit begins?

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2023/11/29/what-is-africas-goal-at-cop28-as-the-climate-summit-begins
<blockquote>
Although Africa is responsible for less than 5 percent of global emissions, it is disproportionately affected by negative climate change impacts. What’s Africa pushing for in Dubai? Most countries by now agree that a pivot or transition away from fossil fuel production or consumption to renewables is inevitable, but a key issue African leaders are pushing is the continent’s right to a just transition. African countries have been demanding that rich countries support them with funds to build infrastructure and put in place measures that will help them adapt to a changing climate and a warmer world – infrastructure like sea walls for those countries facing significant sea level rise problems, for example. Rich countries promised $100bn in annual climate financing for developing nations back in 2009, and renewed that pledge at COP26 in Glasgow; but as of 2020, only $83bn was being raised annually. Meanwhile, the continent needs more than $500bn for climate change adaptation costs through 2030, of which about $11bn was available in 2020. For years, developed nations blocked the creation of the fund, which is meant to see low-emitting developing nations not historically responsible for global warming, get paid for the irreplaceable loss of lives, culture, and infrastructure by climate change, whether in Africa, Asia or elsewhere. “The AGN focuses too much on COP when for developed countries, it’s more of a foreign diplomacy business with multiple ministries working on getting concessions on deals that AGN is not even aware of so by the time they get to COP, a lot has been sorted,” she said. In the resulting Nairobi Declaration, they urged their richer counterparts to commit to past funding pledges, reform unfavourable tax regimes, reduce borrowing costs for African countries, and restructure their debts. In addition to pursuing a right to use gas as a transition fuel, African leaders are also keen to position their countries as ones that can be crucial to climate solutions due to the continent’s natural resources and manpower needed to deliver infrastructure for renewables.

# Israel says truce, captives release will not start ‘before Friday’

<blockquote>
A temporary truce and the release of dozens of captives taken by Palestinian armed group Hamas in its assault on Israel on October 7 will not start before Friday, Tel Aviv has said, as Israeli forces continued to bombard the besieged enclave of Gaza. “The start of the release will take place according to the original agreement between the sides, and not before Friday,” it said. Israel’s public broadcaster Kan, quoting an unidentified Israeli official, reported there was a 24-hour delay because the agreement had not been signed by Hamas and Qatar, which was the key mediator in the deal. “No one said there would be a release tomorrow except the media … We had to make it clear that no release is planned before Friday, because of the uncertainty that hostages’ families are facing,” Kan quoted an unnamed source in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office as saying. More than 14,500 people have been killed in Gaza since Israel began its attacks on the territory in response to Hamas’s assault on Israel that left at least 1,200 people dead.

Taiwan has condemned China for what it called intimidation of its citizenry and attempts to influence the island’s elections on Saturday. The statement was in response to China and Taiwan’s largest opposition party warning that Vice President and presidential hopeful Lai Ching-te, from the governing Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), would be a threat to peace in the region if he wins. “I sincerely hope the majority of Taiwan compatriots recognise the extreme harm of the DPP’s ‘Taiwan independence’ line and the extreme danger of Lai Ching-te’s triggering of cross-Strait confrontation and conflict, and to make the right choice at the crossroads of cross-Strait relations,” said China’s Taiwan Affairs Office in a statement. China has not publicly referred to a preferred candidate but has called the election a choice between war and peace.

# Chinese demographers propose reshaping fertility support policies

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202401/1305500.shtml
<blockquote>
Chinese demographers on Tuesday proposed reshaping fertility support policies to support childbearing women to give birth and promote high-quality population development in response to the established reality of long-term negative population growth in the country. The three-year COVID-19 pandemic, a decrease in the number of women of childbearing age, weak fertility desires, delayed marriage and childbearing are factors that contributed to the negative population growth in 2023, Yuan noted. According to He Dan, director of China Population and Development Research Center, one survey conducted by her center showed that the average ideal number of children for women of childbearing age dropped from 1.95 in 2017 to 1.86 in 2022, and the number of children they intend to have dropped from 1.77 to 1.74. "Though cities have released a slew of supportive policies to support childbearing women to give birth, the public's expectation is still not being met," He Dan emphasized. China's population peaked at 1.413 billion in 2021-22.

<blockquote>
He called for an end to the harassment of civilian vessels in the Red Sea, while noting that the UN Security Council has never authorized any country to use force against Yemen. When the Houthis vowed to attack ships in the Red Sea that are linked to Israel, how did the US respond to that? The missions failed to stop Houthis from attacking shipping, and now Houthis are targeting US ships. China has played a constructive role in fostering peace in the Middle East. In contrast, US' comprehensive and overt support for Israel has directly led to the prolongation and escalation of the war. The biggest difference between China and the US in Middle East affairs is that China is a responsible major power, and its responsible actions have been recognized by all parties, Shen said.

China's Zheng Qinwen came from behind to overpower Ashlyn Krueger of the US in the first round of the Australian Open on Tuesday while two unseeded Chinese players notched the upset of the day. In his debut at Melbourne Park in 2023, he made history to become the first Chinese man to win a main-draw match at the Australian Open in the Open era. Despite saving three match points in the third set, Wang Xiyu was edged out 6-1, 6-7, 7-5 by 27th seed Emma Navarro of the US after a tense match of two hours and 38 minutes.

# A ‘cultural genocide’: Which of Gaza’s heritage sites have been destroyed?

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/14/a-cultural-genocide-which-of-gazas-heritage-sites-have-been-destroyed
<blockquote>
An ancient harbour dating back to 800 BC, a mosque that was home to rare manuscripts and one of the world’s oldest Christian monasteries are just a few of at least 195 heritage sites that have been destroyed or damaged since Israel’s war on Gaza began on October 7, according to an NGO documenting war damage on cultural sites. “The crime of targeting and destroying archaeological sites should spur the world and UNESCO into action to preserve this great civilisational and cultural heritage,” Gaza’s Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities said after Gaza’s Great Omari Mosque was destroyed in an Israeli air strike on December 8. Gaza’s heritage is part of its people, it’s history and their connection.” Farther east and once sitting on a hilltop, Al Qarara Museum (also known as the Khan Younis Museum) was opened in 2016 by Mohamed and Najla Abu Lahia, a husband and wife team who said they wished to preserve a history of Gaza’s lands and heritage for generations to come. Al Qarara Museum was once filled with 3,000 artefacts dating back to the Canaanite era [File: Abdelhakim Abu Riash/AJE] In Gaza City, the 13th-century Qasr Al-Basha, or Pasha’s Palace, was turned into a museum in 2010 by the Palestinian Ministry of Tourism, and a collection of artefacts from different periods of Gaza’s history was on display. The Library of the Great Omari Mosque in Gaza City was once filled with rare manuscripts, including old copies of the Quran, biographies of Prophet Muhammad and ancient books on philosophy, medicine and Sufi mysticism. Gaza’s Tourism and Antiquities Ministry estimated that as many as 104 mosques have been damaged or destroyed since the start of the Israeli assault. The Sayed al-Hashim Mosque, built sometime in the 12th century and rebuilt in 1850, was damaged in an October air strike. On December 8, it was destroyed in an Israeli air strike. After an air strike last month, all that remains of the Great Omari Mosque is its damaged Mamluk-era minaret [File: Abdelhakim Abu Riash/AJE] The mosque had been used as a place of worship by the local Muslim community since 1291 and had served as a focal point for gatherings and cultural activities. It was also struck on October 19 and was also damaged during World War I and again during the 2014 assault by Israel on Gaza. At the time, the ministry’s Nariman Khella said: “The church was discovered during the paving of Salah al-Din Street, and the first thing that was discovered were two tombs, one for an old person and the other for a young child.” That same year, a farmer discovered a series of intricate mosaics nearby. As for the historic church itself, it was destroyed in October by Israeli air strikes. The site, which UNESCO added to its Tentative World Heritage list in 2012, has been damaged in the Israeli bombardments. He is thought to have been buried on the grounds of the church. Like other significant sites, this church was turned into a mosque in the seventh century but reverted back to a church in the 1150s when Crusaders reclaimed it. The Holy Family Church in Gaza City was hit in a November air strike, destroying part of a school [File: Mohammed Abed/AFP] Other heritage sites A Palestinian archaeologist works on a lead sarcophagus unearthed at a Roman-era necropolis discovered in Gaza City in early 2022 [File: Mahmud Hamz/AFP] Its damage to the site is unknown,” he said. Alatel has worked to preserve Gaza’s heritage and archaeology through countless Israeli air strikes but said this time the situation is much worse and he has been unable to return to the site to survey the extent of the damage. It has been destroyed. After Roman temple ruins and mosaic floors were discovered on the 5-acre (2-hectare) archaeological site, it was placed by UNESCO on its Tentative World Heritage list in 2012. The area had a thriving Jewish community until Crusader rule in the 12th century. It was established about 2000 to 1800 BC and has been damaged in the Israeli bombardment. The status of Gaza’s many other historic sites remains unknown. There has been shelling in the area, Alatel said, but it is as yet unknown what has become of the sacred site.

# Trauma replaces joy for mothers giving birth during Israel’s war on Gaza

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/1/17/trauma-replaces-joy-for-mother-giving-birth-during-israels-war-on-gaza
<blockquote>
Al Jazeera spoke to three women sheltering in a United Nations school in Jabalia in northern Gaza about their pregnancies and births, the losses they have suffered and whether they are able to derive joy from the arrival of their babies. “But the worst was my grief over my husband and not having him there with me during the birth.” Aya’s labour started on Christmas Eve, escalating through the night until her parents took her to the shelter’s clinic at 2am and ran everywhere trying to find a midwife to help her with the birth. Aya is one of thousands of women in Gaza forced to give birth and care for their newborns under Israel’s war in retaliation for Hamas’s attacks on October 7. Raeda Raeda al-Masry holds her son as she recounts fleeing to Jabalia refugee camp and giving birth in a school without help [Sanad Agency/Al Jazeera] Raeda is from Beit Hanoon and was displaced to Jabalia in the early days of the war. “The block we were sheltering in was bombed, and I was pulled out from under the rubble by the rescuers, me and my older son, who is 14 months old,” she says, explaining how they came to move to the school. “My wish for my son is that he lives, that he has safety, that he has food, diapers even. Um Raed also sits holding her baby boy, swaddled in a fuzzy blanket and sleeping soundly, perhaps reassured by the sound of his mother’s voice and her rocking motions as she holds him. He has been sick often since his birth, Um Raed says, her eyes wide and serious, the frustration of not being able to do more for her child apparent on her face. “I reached full term here in the school shelter,” she recounts, “but my labour wasn’t starting, probably from the fear I was living in. In the longer run, she says, she wishes what any mother would wish for her child, that Raed grows up in a healthy environment, in peace and not suffering from want and not learning about war at such a young age.

# Xi calls for strengthening patriotic united forces as security authority warns secessionists

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202401/1305510.shtml
<blockquote>
The united front work should strengthen the patriotic united forces in Taiwan, and oppose the separatist acts of "Taiwan independence" forces, Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, said in an article published in the flagship magazine of the CPC Central Committee on Tuesday. Also on Tuesday, the Ministry of State Security (MSS) warned in a WeChat article that the Anti-Secession Law is "a sharp sword hanging over the heads of Taiwan secessionists," stating that the sword is only targeting secessionists instead of Taiwan compatriots, in order to safeguard China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The mainland will resolutely suppress and contain the "Taiwan independence" secessionist forces, but for the Taiwan people and groups from different sectors who support the 1992 Consensus, the mainland still welcomes cross-Straits interaction and integrated development, Wang said. By stressing the Anti-Secession Law at this moment, the MSS is warning Lai, who is regarded as a more stubborn and diehard secessionist than Tsai Ing-wen, that "do not think that you can do whatever you want after being elected," Zheng said. On Tuesday, the defense authority on the island of Taiwan said in a press release that it had detected 15 aircraft and three vessels of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) around the island over the past day.

# Will new criminal bills turn India into a police state ahead of 2024 vote?

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/17/will-new-criminal-bills-turn-india-into-a-police-state-ahead-of-2024-vote
<blockquote>
New Delhi, India – Late last month India’s parliament passed two sets of controversial legislation in the biggest overhaul of the criminal justice system and telecom laws that critics say could greatly increase police powers and facilitate mass surveillance. However, critics claim that the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government has used the discourse of decolonisation to enact laws that are more draconian than the laws they are replacing. Now that the window has increased, it may become even more difficult to get bail,” Bharat Chugh, a former judge at Delhi’s criminal courts and Supreme Court lawyer said. With courts hesitant to grant bail during the possibility of police custody, the change in law could have “grave implications for life and personal liberty”, said Chugh. Sedition: In 2022, India’s Supreme Court had temporarily suspended the 154-year-old law on sedition, a colonial-era provision that criminalises speech or actions against the government or authority with the possibility of a death sentence. The new criminal statutes do not incorporate any such safeguard while bringing “terrorism” as an offence within them. “This gives the police officers unchecked discretion to pick one law over the other, or in many cases, invoke both laws. Some of the changes to the criminal procedure code, such as the increase in duration for which people can be kept in police custody, are “quite troubling,” Chugh said. The Telecommunications Act provides for a simpler licensing regime for telecom networks, a framework for the interception of messages and internet suspension – without safeguards, and introduces the biometric authentication of users, raising concerns about privacy. Apar Gupta, advocate and former executive director of the Internet Freedom Foundation, said the new law “cements authoritarian control over the rights of ordinary citizens”. Not only has a special offence like “terrorism” been included in the ordinary penal code, but its definition, too, has been widened. India’s special law for “anti-terror”, the UAPA, requires an act to be a “violent act” to be considered a terrorist act. The new penal code, however, could potentially implicate peaceful, non-violent acts with a definition of terrorism if they meet other criteria, such as any action that could threaten “unity, integrity … of India … by using any other means of whatever nature”. As I said earlier, a criminal law, by its very nature, should be precise.” The new definition also includes any act that threatens the “economic security of India” as terrorism. “For instance, if an investigation is carried out under the earlier criminal procedure code, but further investigation is sought to be done under the new one, which law would apply?” Chugh asked. Radhika Roy, a lawyer at the Internet Freedom Foundation, said that by setting these standards for different OTT platforms, the new law can now “potentially authorise the government to obtain identification of first originator of information through backdoor mechanisms or even the creation of lists that could pick up certain words – think mass surveillance”.

# Pakistan launches military strikes on Iran in response to bombing

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/18/pakistan-launches-precise-military-strikes-on-iran-in-response-to-bombing
<blockquote>
On Thursday morning, according to a statement from its Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Pakistan conducted what it called an “intelligence-based operation” against hideouts of armed groups in the Sistan-Baluchistan province of Iran. Pakistan also shared multiple dossiers with concrete evidence of the presence and activities of these terrorists,” the foreign ministry said in a statement. This morning’s action was taken in light of credible intelligence of impending large scale terrorist activities by these Sarmachars. The sole objective of today’s act was in pursuit of Pakistan’s own security and national interest which is paramount and cannot be compromised,” the statement added. However, on Wednesday, Amirabdollahian said the attack on “Pakistan’s soil” was in response to the group’s recent attacks on the Iranian city of Rask in the southeastern province of Sistan-Baluchistan. Emphasising that while Iran respected the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Pakistan, he said the country would make no compromises on its own security. We have talked with Pakistani officials several times on this matter,” he added. China, a close ally of both Pakistan and Iran, said it is willing to mediate between the two countries after the exchange of fire. We understand actions that countries take in their self-defense,” India’s foreign ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.

# China-US freight rates rise amid Red Sea crisis

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202401/1305513.shtml
<blockquote>
On the East Coast, the rate jumped from $3,600 to about $6,000, leading to container congestion, data that the Global Times received from the Shanghai International Shipping Institute showed on Tuesday. "The Red Sea crisis has driven up shipping costs and indirectly boosted freight rates to the US," Kang Shuchun, a director of the China Federation of Logistics and Purchasing, told the Global Times on Tuesday. Moreover, the high shipping rates, while putting pressure on trade businesses, suggest that US demand for Chinese-made products remains resilient and strong, several industry insiders told the Global Times on Tuesday.

# US launches new strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/18/us-launches-new-strikes-on-houthi-targets-in-yemen
<blockquote>
The United States military says its forces launched strikes on 14 Houthi missiles “that were loaded to be fired” from Yemen in the fourth day of direct attacks on the Iran-aligned group in less than a week. The strikes are meant to degrade the Houthis’ “capabilities to continue their reckless attacks on international and commercial shipping in the Red Sea, the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, and the Gulf of Aden”, it added. The Houthis said the designation will not affect its operations to prevent Israeli ships or vessels heading to Israel from crossing the Red Sea, the Arabian Sea and the Bab al-Mandeb Strait.

# Australia should avoid turning itself from ‘idyllic haven’ into battlefield, warn analysts as Japan eyes military contingencies cooperation

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202401/1305506.shtml
<blockquote>
Japan and Australia, both countries in the Asia-Pacific region, should have a shared interest in maintaining peace and stability in the region, but as loyal allies of the US, the two countries are eyeing colluding to stir up troubles and adding new factors of instability into the region with their latest move to discuss cooperation on "military contingencies," experts noted. Japanese media outlet the Japan Times on Monday cited government sources revealing that Japan and Australia are discussing potential military cooperation in case of "scenarios where emergencies arise simultaneously in both the East and South China Seas." Japan has promised to acquire "counterstrike capabilities" by developing homemade long-range missiles, along with procuring US-produced Tomahawk cruise missiles, as a deterrent against regional security threats, the news report said. "As countries in the region, Japan and Australia should prioritize maintaining stability rather than participating in the US' Indo-Pacific Strategy which mainly targets China," Song warned. Both the US and Japan see Australia as an important strategic buffer zone in case of military contingencies, Song said, noting that Japan wants to woo Australia to contain China.

# Pakistan-Iran border tensions: A timeline

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/17/a-recap-of-violence-pak-iran-border
<blockquote>
On Wednesday, Pakistan recalled its ambassador from Tehran after denouncing the attack and barred Iran’s envoy to Islamabad — who is travelling — from returning to Pakistan. The Jaish al-Adl (Army of Justice), which is blacklisted by Iran as a “terror” group, claimed responsibility for a police station attack in the Iranian town of Rask in the southeastern border province of Sistan-Baluchestan, which killed 11 Iranian security personnel. Shehbaz Sharif, who was Pakistan’s prime minister at the time, condemned the killing of four security officials along the border with Iran in Balochistan. The attack took place following the reopening of the border between the two countries for bilateral trade on September 20, following a four-month closure over security concerns. IRGC said three Iranian security personnel were killed by armed fighters in a cross-border attack on a border post in the city of Mirjaveh in Sistan-Baluchestan province. Jaish al-Adl has been launching attacks against Iranian border guards since at least 2013 when it killed 14 Iranian soldiers in an ambush near the border.

# China releases preview of Xinjiang documentary, presenting unique landscape, cultures and an improvement in people's livelihood

<blockquote>
The preview of the documentary shows the three hosts travel extensively across Xinjiang region, located in China's far western frontier, bordering several countries in Central Asia including Afghanistan, Pakistan and Tajikistan. Xinjiang is "the frontier of China and the heart of Eurasia," the video says. The diversified development and opportunities in the region have also attracted many people from all over the country to travel there, with some even choosing to settle there. Whether it is the story of Xinjiang locals or outsiders who came to Xinjiang from other parts of the country to study and settle down, it's clear that people of all ethnic groups have achieved prosperity with a sense of unity, cooperation, as well as economic and social development. However, there have been many rumors and smears about Xinjiang's social and development situation that seriously deviate from the facts, and what has been seen in reality is that people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are full of hope in the process of pursuing and realizing a better life.

# The dark underbelly of Pakistan’s male body image revolution

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/1/14/the-dark-underbelly-of-pakistans-male-body-image-revolution
<blockquote>
Karachi, Pakistan – In a small room in his modest family home, Asad Naqib Khan threads a sewing machine needle. “For as long as I can remember, I have wanted to become a bodybuilder,” he explains while hemming a shirt that morning in early 2022. “Once, I went to watch a bodybuilding competition and wanted to become just like the men I saw on the stage,” he recalls. As the eldest son, Asad felt compelled to share his father’s financial responsibilities as soon as he became a teenager. When he was 18, he branched out on his own. He envisions introducing his sons to bodybuilding, and also has aspirations to open his own gym, like Zahir, which his boys can one day help him run “so I don’t have to work as a tailor any more.” Asad Naqib Khan, 28, works as a tailor by day to support his family and his bodybuilding ambitions [Saad Zuberi/Al Jazeera] A hidden world Since Pakistan’s first championship was held in 1952, bodybuilding has remained largely a working-class pursuit – it is often referred to as a “poor man’s sport” within the community – and confined to small-scale regional and national competitions. Asad, and about two dozen other young men, are busy lifting weights. On the packed floor of his gym, Zahir watches the movements of his clients. Asad has dinner after working out at the gym [Saad Zuberi/Al Jazeera] Gaining confidence Usama recalls how they would incessantly poke fun at his scrawny build, suggesting that no girl could ever be interested in him and how he “would go flying in the air if they so much as blew air on me … that’s hurtful for any young man.” Usama, who was 21 at the time and still recovering from his disease, says he withdrew into a shell and became a complete recluse. “I had zero body confidence and couldn’t face people … That’s when my best friend encouraged me to go to the gym with him.” “But I had made up my mind.” “My mother began noticing the changes in me; how people would watch me in public and how I was getting my confidence back, she accepted it … My family is proud of me now, but I wish they had supported my decision early on,” he says. I had no idea how dangerous this was.” A coach prepares to inject his trainee with an anabolic steroid [Saad Zuberi/Al Jazeera] ‘Not allowed to say “no” to your coach’ The risks associated with steroids and growth hormones rarely deter coaches, Usama says. Gym owners and coaches are notorious for encouraging the use of substances among their most talented athletes and even paying for the drugs as these men effectively act as living advertisements for their establishments, Usama explains. He says he has witnessed coaches make their own capsules and distribute them to inexperienced athletes. “They are just in it to make a quick buck … they are playing with their lives,” he says, shaking his head with disapproval. That is particularly true when the coach is your sponsor, Usama says. “I was very happy when my coach offered me my first job as a trainer,” he recalls. “When they invest their money in you, they make you feel special,” he explains, “then they expect you to submit to them completely.” “It’s very easy for them to get you banned, so you have to be careful … You are simply not allowed to say ‘no’ to your coach.” In 2020, after two years of professional bodybuilding, Usama decided to stop competing so he could focus on his work as a trainer, and quit taking performance-enhancing drugs. In 2021, the sudden death of 51-year-old Shehzad Khan Afridi, a celebrated bodybuilder and former Mr Pakistan, the biggest national bodybuilding championship, just days after winning a gold medal in the 75kg (165-pound) category of a competition held in Karachi, drew attention to the potentially life-threatening abuse of substances taking place behind the closed doors of Pakistan’s gyms. Afridi’s death was the most publicised in Pakistan in recent times, but it was not the only one. Those with more serious job aspirations look to get professional portfolios made in hopes of gaining new followers but also securing paid modelling work. He has taken the day off from his administrative government day job to travel two hours by public bus from the city of Mardan to Islamabad for the photoshoot, and has come to Kamran with a specific request: to look like a warrior in his new photos. “If I don’t look a certain way or don’t maintain how I look, nobody will come to me for training.” As the day winds down and Usama’s last clients head out, his friend invites him back to the gym floor to snap photos and shoot workout videos for each other’s social media. “This is my bread and butter now and I have to be more strategic in how I sell myself to the public,” he says, referring to how he relies on his social media profiles to draw in potential gym clients. “A lot of them are from women, but the majority are from men who only have sex on their mind,” he says, scrolling through a long list of unread messages. Hammad, Zishan, Usama, Asad, and Zahir, along with countless other bodybuilders from their community say exploitation is a reality for many trying to get into modelling. Usama, whose coach once plied him with steroids and growth hormones, says there’s a culture in bodybuilding of not saying ‘no’ to one’s coach. At the same time, he found that breaking into modelling was similarly challenging due to exploitation by powerful people in the industry [Saad Zuberi/Al Jazeera] ‘There is a predator at every corner’ “It was a huge deal for me and I was very excited,” he reflects. He made it clear to me that if I went along, he would make me a star by hiring me for all his future shows and campaigns; that he would take care of me like a ‘sugar daddy’.” Recently, Zishan says a photographer invited him to his Islamabad studio with the promise of a potential modelling job. People can do anything for money.” “When I got to the apartment, the man and two other guys said they would have to ‘audition’ me to assess the kind of clients they could refer to me,” he adds, looking up with a grimace. “I just never imagined it would be like this.”

<blockquote>
Khan Younis, Gaza – To pick up a weak data signal for his phone, Hussein Owda had to stand a bit too close to a group of women and girls waiting in line for their turn to use the communal bathrooms. The media producer for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) had just returned to his agency’s training centre – where he and his family are sheltering – after spending a week in the Nasser Hospital ICU with his father, who had had a serious heart attack. His daughter Lin is eight years old, his son Mahmoud is six, and his youngest is Zein, a little boy of 16 months. “But in a primitive life, you would expect to have some privacy or even enough space to stretch out on the ground to sleep, but that’s not the case with this primitive life.” For someone who lost his brand-new apartment on the day he and his family moved in, Owda is keeping in good spirits. One night as they were on the road, they settled in to sleep as best they could and Owda started talking to his eldest, his daughter Lin. Mahmoud listens as his sister Lin tells Hussein Owda how the family was definitely not camping [Courtesy of Hussein Owda] At the beginning of their displacement, Owda says, Lin, Mahmoud and Zein were terrified of the sounds of the bombs and the aircraft flying overhead, but now they don’t seem to react as much. “Look, I don’t have it so bad, you know,” he said. Imagine what kind of grinding futility they are living in.”

# Chinese, US researchers jointly develop new type of stable semiconductor graphene with 10 times higher performance than silicon

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202401/1305386.shtml
<blockquote>
Researchers from China and the US have jointly created a new type of stable semiconductor graphene, which displays performance 10 times higher than silicon and 20 times larger than the performance of the other two-dimensional semiconductors. The achievement marks "a leap from silicon chips to carbon chips," Ma Lei, leader of the research from the Tianjin International Center for Nanoparticles and Nanosystems (TICNN) at Tianjin University, told the Global Times. By precisely controlling the epitaxial growth process of graphene, Ma's team introduced a bandgap into graphene, creating a new type of stable semiconductor graphene, which exhibits electron mobility far exceeding that of silicon materials. Ma said that now he and his team are working hard to grow larger-sized graphene semiconductor single crystals. However, overall, the cooperation between the two teams has been fruitful. I hope that cooperation is the mainstream and competition is a stimulant.

<blockquote>
In December, Osman Arbab*, 24, and his younger brother were on a bus just outside Atbara, Sudan, when military intelligence stopped it and asked which of the passengers were from Darfur or Kordofan. The military intelligence officers told them all they were accused of spying for the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) paramilitary group and took them to a facility in Atbara in northeastern Sudan. For six days, Arbab and his brother were beaten with sticks to try to extract confessions from them. “My brother [has diabetes], and I remember thinking that we’re not going to make it out of here,” Arbab told Al Jazeera. Survivors and local monitors said security forces are mainly targeting people who originate from Kordofan in southern Sudan or Darfur in the west, which are seen as RSF strongholds. In Kordofan, most army battalions are made up of local “non-Arab” Nubians and local “Arabs”. “In South Kordofan, there has always been tension based on ethnic and tribal lines, even in the army,” said Hafiz Mohamad, a Sudanese researcher from South Kordofan. Mohamad told Al Jazeera that in Sudan’s previous civil wars, it was Nuba soldiers and civilians who were accused of collaborating with mainly “non-Arab” rebel groups. Now, things have changed and “Arabs” are being targeted. On December 16, the army withdrew from Sudan’s second-largest city, Wad Madani after the RSF captured it. At the time, “Arab” tribal militias – which were supported by the army and later repackaged as the RSF – targeted civilians based on ethnicity. They were stopped in Gadarif, a state in eastern Sudan, and taken to a detention centre and interrogated.

# UK takes centre stage in Red Sea action, targeting Yemen’s Houthis

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/16/britain-takes-centre-stage-in-red-sea-action
<blockquote>
Last December, after Yemen-based Houthis attacked international shipping in support of Hamas, the UK joined the US to lead the multinational Operation Prosperity Guardian in the Red Sea. Some 15 percent of the world’s marine traffic passes through the Bab al-Mandeb Strait, which separates the Indian Ocean from the Red Sea. One-third of the world’s oil is moved by Greek-owned ships. “Incidents that were widely reported off Yemen in the last quarter of 2022 alerted everyone to the need to adopt a prudential stance.” Not everyone in Europe has seen a similar need for the use of force. The risk of escalation is certainly present. And the Houthis may still have powerful weapons. They attacked a US-owned ship three days after the punitive attacks by the US and UK. “Britain considers that in the Middle East, it is still a great power … it is effectively saying, ‘I need to maintain a presence there and keep an eye on events because I know the region well,’” said Syrigos. Whether the UK’s action in the Red Sea proves as popular as its forceful stance in Ukraine remains to be seen.

# Death threats for a Stalin vandal prompt soul-searching in Orthodox Georgia

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/17/death-threats-for-a-stalin-vandal-prompt-soul-searching-in-orthodox-georgia

Tbilisi, Georgia – When Nata Peradze heard that an icon featuring Joseph Stalin was on display inside Georgia’s largest cathedral, she decided to take action. There were priests on my father’s side and on my mother’s there were dissidents. “I had my method. The icon was displayed at Tbilisi’s Holy Trinity Cathedral, Georgia’s largest cathedral [Robin Forestier-Walker/Al Jazeera] In step with the Kremlin’s rehabilitation of Stalin as a wise and honourable leader who is given all the credit for the defeat of Nazi Germany, there has been a resurgence in Stalin’s popularity in Georgia, with at least 11 new statues of him appearing since the governing Georgian Dream party came to power in 2012. “When an icon of a saint is painted, episodes of their life are presented on this icon, and one such episode is Stalin’s meeting with Matrona, when the representative of the godless regime, the ruler, had to meet the saint,” she said. “The Georgian Orthodox Church plays a significant role in maintaining [Stalin’s] image as a religious person. It’s going to become very important in 2024 around election time, but right now it’s not [helpful] for the government to have this divisive topic at the moment.” Peradze, who posted a video on Facebook of the painting daubed with blue paint, went into hiding after Alt-Info, another far-right nationalist group, shared her address on its Telegram channel. “Previously they have said they couldn’t stop [far-right demonstrators].

# Dim hopes in Ghana as Black Stars attempt to end 42-year-old AFCON jinx

First, there was a January 8 performance to forget as the Black Stars, ranked 61st in world football, laboured to a goalless draw against 115th-ranked Namibia in front of their home fans in a preparation match in Kumasi. Cape Verde’s players celebrate after winning at the end of the AFCON Group B football match against Ghana at the Felix Houphouet-Boigny Stadium in Abidjan on January 14, 2024 [Sia Kambou/AFP] Little optimism back home “Even Mozambique, it will be a miracle if we get a draw. Even if we progress from the group stage, we’ll meet Nigeria and other heavyweights, so I don’t think we have a chance.” Many of his compatriots are indifferent about the chances of the team in Ivory Coast, a hunch fuelled by Ghana’s poor run of form. “Hughton’s failure to advance the Black Stars’ playing style has left many Ghanaian football fans feeling pessimistic about the team’s prospects in Ivory Coast.” For many in Ghana, unconditional support for the national team has now become mere tolerance, and they say it is because the Black Stars have consistently failed to shine at successive tournaments, undoing the bond they used to share with the fans. But, he added, in a rather regretful tone: “It’s a shame many of the current generation have never experienced this feeling.

# Israel’s new $15bn war budget: What’s it for and what gets cut?

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/16/israels-new-15bn-war-budget-whats-it-for-and-what-gets-cut
<blockquote>
On Monday, Netanyahu’s cabinet approved an increased budget for 2024, which allocates an additional 55 billion shekels ($15bn) for the war as well as increased funding for other departments despite fraught deliberations that caused the education minister, Yoav Kisch, to storm out in a rage when proposals to cut funding to his department were put forward. “What is required now is, first of all, to cover the expenses of the war and to allow us to conduct the war in the coming year and complete it, including eliminating Hamas, returning our hostages and restoring security and the sense of security in both the north and the south so that the residents can return there,” he told his cabinet. Israel’s war on Gaza – which has killed more than 24,000 Palestinians, with thousands more lost under the rubble and presumed dead, and has injured tens of thousands more – has cost the country about $269m each day since it began on October 7. As a result of this new budget, the deficit for 2024 has widened to 6.6 percent of Israel’s GDP. The new, 582-billion-shekel ($155bn) budget for 2024 has been reached by cutting funding for government departments by an average of 3 percent and increasing spending by $18.6bn. What will the extra $15bn pay for? His department duly received an extra $534m in the new budget. With the war on Gaza now more than three months old, “people forget that the 10 months before the war was [already] a time of political instability and protest [in Israel],” Mekelberg said.

# China achieves 5.2% GDP growth in 2023

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202401/1305571.shtml
<blockquote>
China posted a GDP growth of 5.2 percent for 2023 on Wednesday, successfully meeting last year's annual target and in line with market forecast. Contribution of the Chinese economy to the world economy is expected to exceed 30 percent with China becoming the largest growth engine of global growth, Kang said, noting that the increase of China's GDP in 2023, at more than 6 trillion yuan, equals to the whole year GDP of a medium-sized country. Cao Heping, an economist at Peking University, told the Global Times on Wednesday that the fact that the Chinese economy can achieve a 5.2-percent growth rate under the severe conditions last year is a proof that the Chinese economy has firmly set its foot on the track of new economy, which is powered by digital technologies. NBS' Kang said the Chinese economy is expected to continue on a recovery track and faces more opportunities than challenges in 2024 as factors supporting the high-quality development of the Chinese economy are converging. Xing Zhaopeng, senior China strategist with ANZ Research, said China is expected to set a GDP growth target of 5 percent for 2024 and "potential growth should still be above 5 percent." "On the positive side, consumption of goods will continue to expand as the lingering effect of the pandemic fades further away in 2024 and employment and resident income continue to improve, resulting in further lifting up of consumer confidence," Zhou said.

# Silver screen expat talents’ new frontier

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202401/1305455.shtml
<blockquote>
In a global movie industry that is all too eager to ape the Hollywood blueprint, it would be forgivable for one to assume that China's own industry has also fallen in line with not only the Westernization of cinema, but the concomitant "yankification" of the same. Period pieces, apart from being cinematically appealing, complete with historically accurate costumes and set design, also feature a conspicuous set of actors otherwise rarely seen in Chinese cinema - foreign supporting actors. Far from being mere space fillers in scenes, however, these foreign actors are not only important but are, more times than not, required to possess a mid- to high-level of Putonghua fluency, and should have combat, acrobatic, or stunt experience for fight scenes set out in the movie's plot. "It's not just about delivering a performance but understanding the intricate details that contribute to a believable portrayal. Actor and stunt professional Fredrik Yderström not only represents a growing number of foreign professionals in the Chinese film industry, but also the direct absorption of graduates from Chinese universities directly or tangentially linked to the industry. With the further streamlining of regulations governing foreign professionals in China, Yderström hopes that the changes will also positively impact the movie industry, further helping establish its foreign professionals in the industry and the country. This bodes well for the expansion of China's movie repertoire, further appealing to an increasingly interested international audience, as foreign actors in Chinese productions and TV shows offer a snapshot of a more inclusive and open country.

# New climate envoy to continue work for global green transition: Chinese FM

# Philippine President should read more to develop a proper understanding of the Taiwan question: Chinese FM

<blockquote>
China suggests Philippines' President Ferdinand Marcos Jr read more to develop a proper understanding of the ins and outs of the Taiwan question, the Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated on Tuesday, in response to Marcos' comments on the Taiwan regional election results, with Chinese experts noting that there is disagreement within the Philippines on how to handle relations with China, and Marcos might be considering how to use the situation across the Taiwan Straits as a bargaining chip toward China. Also on Tuesday, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in the Philippines opposed Marcos' statement, stating that the one-China principle is the political basis for the establishment and development of diplomatic relations between China and 182 countries, including the Philippines. Marcos' remarks violate the one-China principle, which China firmly opposes, Gu said, noting that the statement made by the Philippine Department of Foreign Affairs means that it still hopes to develop friendly and good-neighborly relations with China, and clearly knows that the Taiwan question is at the core of China's interests and a red line that cannot be touched.

# As PM, India’s Modi secretly tried to massively cut state funds

https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2024/1/18/as-pm-indias-modi-secretly-tried-to-massively-cut-state-funds
<blockquote>
At the same time, Modi falsely claimed in Parliament that he welcomed the Finance Commission’s recommendations on the tax portions to be allocated to the states. As a joint secretary in the prime minister’s office, he was the liaison in the backdoor negotiations between Modi and the chairman of the Finance Commission, YV Reddy. Hours after The Reporters’ Collective sent detailed queries to the Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), public access to the video of the seminar was cut off on the CSEP YouTube channel. Per India’s Constitution, an independent Finance Commission, made up of economists and public finance experts, decides what percentage of money the federal government should share with the states from its tax collections, excluding those it labels as “cess” or “surcharges”. The 14th Finance Commission was set up in 2013. In its report that it submitted in December 2014, the commission recommended that states should get 42 percent of the share of central taxes, up from the 32 percent they had been receiving until then. But Modi, now the prime minister, and his Ministry of Finance, wanted to keep the states’ share of taxes down at 33 percent and a larger portion for the federal government. Under the constitutional provisions, the government has only two options: accept the Finance Commission’s recommendations or reject them and establish a new commission. The previous number was 32,” he said, referring to the percentage share of taxes recommended by the 13th Finance Commission. The government had to accept the Finance Commission’s recommendations of 42 percent. The Reporters’ Collective verified from an official who was part of the 14th Finance Commission that there had been a delay in accepting the report and conversations about potentially altering it. We could have taken advantage of that. Two days because this recommendation is accepted so late, so late and everything was written at that time … in a conference room in NITI Aayog. While the numbers he rattled off were not precise, the government did significantly cut allocations by nearly half from 211 billion rupees ($3.4bn) in the budget for the financial year ending March 2015 to 102 billion rupees ($1.6bn) the next year after it had to accept the higher proportion of payment to the states. One of the key concerns of domestic and international investors is the level of fiscal deficit the government carries at any given time – how much it is spending in excess of what it earns from taxes and other revenues, through borrowings. Governments, therefore, try accounting tricks to meet their expenses from borrowings that can be kept out of budget documents, better known as “off-budget borrowing”. It did disclose better than it had so far, but as Subrahmanyam admitted, it was not enough. In other words, based on the fake utilisation certificate that had been submitted, the federal government sent the second tranche of funds. During that period, cesses and surcharges rose from 13.9 percent to 18.4 percent as a share of gross tax revenue. Referring to the rise in cesses and surcharges, Subrahmanyam said: “So, if that is the case and these are part of the non-divisible pool, then states would be wary of ceding more and more of their autonomy in taxation.” It cannot say it is right or wrong.

# ‘Has to be built’: The temple at the heart of Modi’s India re-election bid

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/1/16/with-controversial-temple-launch-modi-to-start-2024-india-re-election-bid
<blockquote>
Ayodhya, India – For hundreds of years, a journey to Ayodhya for many Hindu pilgrims meant a walk down narrow lanes to the Hanuman Garhi Mandir, a temple honouring Hanuman, the monkey god. The queue leads to a statue of Ram, which will give way to a new one that has been selected in a nationwide competition and will be moved to the venue on January 17. Built on the ruins of a mosque of the 16th century, Babri Masjid, which Hindu activists demolished in December 1992, the temple is close to the site that is believed by many Hindus to be the birthplace of Lord Ram, a personification of the victory of good over evil. “We are very happy with the temple,” said Daudas, the chief priest at Hanuman Garhi, adding that it would be good for the economy of the city too. But, he added, “No one disputes the importance of the temple and the fact that it has to be built.” Had he ever prayed to Ram before? The party in power then in Uttar Pradesh is now in opposition. India’s mostly pro-government mainstream media has savaged the Congress over its decision — the BJP and its allies portray India’s Grand Old Party as anti-Hindu and focused on the interests of Muslims. “Mr Kharge has brought in new clarity that the new president would not be part of any congregation in which the RSS chief would be a major presence.” The Congress is the hub around which the opposition alliance, called INDIA, has been built.

# Have the Houthi Red Sea attacks hurt Israel’s economy?

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/13/have-the-houthi-red-sea-attacks-hurt-israels-economy
<blockquote>
Traffic through the Red Sea is down by more than 40 percent disrupting global supply chains. But just how much have the Houthi attacks impacted Israel’s economy itself? And how are they affecting global trade? Currently, around 12 percent of the world’s shipping passes through the Red Sea, averaging around 50 ships a day, carrying between $3bn to $9bn worth of cargo. Are all shipping vessels affected? As of mid-December, Israel’s only Red Sea Port, at Eilat, reported an 85 percent drop in activity since the attacks began. While analysts have agreed that the direct impact of the Houthi rebel attacks on Israel’s economy has been limited, the longer the disruptions continue, the greater the repercussions might be. According to Drewry World Container Index, which tracks shipping along eight major routes between US, Europe and Asia, the cost of transporting a 40-foot (12-metre) container from China to Europe is expected to increase by 248 percent from $1,148 in November, when the attacks began. However, while increases in transport costs can lead to inflation – the International Monetary Fund estimated that chaos in shipping routes during the pandemic led to a 1 percent increase in global inflation –  that has not happened yet, economists have suggested.

Islamabad, Pakistan – Iran’s air attacks on Tuesday night inside Pakistani territory in the southwestern province of Balochistan threaten to pull Islamabad into a broader regional conflict, analysts warn, less than a month before national elections. The bombings, which Iran said were aimed at the armed group Jaish al-Adl (Army of Justice), resulted in the death of at least two children while injuring three more, according to a statement by the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The responsibility for the consequences will lie squarely with Iran,” it said in a statement.

Sign up for Al Jazeera Week in the Middle East Catch up on our coverage of the region, all in one place.

The countries share a roughly 900km (559-mile) long border in Pakistan’s southwest and Iran’s southeast. On the other hand, Kamran Bokhari, senior director for the Washington, DC-based New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy, said Pakistan could respond with its own attacks – though that could mean a potentially longer-term conflict for Pakistan. It could seek a public apology via diplomatic channels from the highest Iranian officials, but if those efforts fail, Pakistan could also consider a military response to the Iranian attack,” Tipu told Al Jazeera.

# Passenger trips during Spring Festival rush to reach 9b, as China's economy on course to recover

<blockquote>
Tourists are seen at an ice amusement spot in sunset on the Songhuajiang River Harbin section in Harbin, northeast China's Heilongjiang Province, Jan. 7, 2024. China is expected to see 9 billion passenger trips during the upcoming Spring Festival travel rush in 2024, likely hitting a new high, the Ministry of Transport said on Tuesday. Passenger trips by air will exceed 80 million, up 9.8 percent from 2019 and 44.9 percent from 2023, and are likely to reach a record high, said Liang Nan, an official of the Civil Aviation Administration of China. The travel boom will have a positive impact on China's economic recovery this year, as the prosperity of the Spring Festival rush will directly drive the rebound of related industries such as transportation, tourism and catering, Wang said, noting that it will also boost consumer confidence, laying a good foundation for stable economic growth throughout the year. "In addition to the return of workers to their hometowns, a large number of people are expected to choose to travel in China and abroad during the vacation period," Li Chang'an, a professor at the Academy of China Open Economy Studies of the University of International Business and Economics, told Global Times on Tuesday.

# GT Voice: India’s geopolitical game hurts outlook for Nepal’s hydropower

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202401/1305531.shtml
<blockquote>
Indeed, India's power trade policy, which prohibits the purchase of electricity produced by projects invested by Chinese companies, has cast a shadow on the investment dynamics of Nepal's energy infrastructure. China has not only invested in hydropower projects in Nepal, but it has also discussed a cross-border transmission line with Nepal, which may be a solution to Nepal's export needs. If geopolitics is set aside, it will find that there is cooperation space between China and India on this issue, which is beneficial for all parties in the region. In addition to hydropower projects, China and Nepal also have cooperation involving other infrastructure projects, which are also beneficial for regional development, such as the China-Nepal railway that is intended to greatly improve connectivity in South Asia. If India is really concerned about its influence in the region, it is advised to invest more and help Nepal and other regional countries with infrastructure development, promoting regional economic prosperity.

The bloc remained Guangxi's largest trading partner for the 24th consecutive year, and imports and exports with ASEAN accounted for 48.9 percent of Guangxi's total trade, Yang Baoqing, a deputy director of Nanning Customs, said at a press briefing on Monday. In 2023, Guangxi imported 16.71 billion yuan worth of agricultural products from ASEAN countries, 43.1 percent higher than in 2022.

# Unreliable rating system calls for credibility check

If it has a score of 4.8 or above on a 5-point scale, the restaurant is guaranteed to be a good choice; 4.5 points may be worth trying, but if it is a 4 or even less, it almost always means the restaurant is so terrible that you are likely to suffer. In essence, people are no longer entirely convinced by ratings and related reviews posted online after they have found that specific high scores failed to live up to their reputation. But what is essential for everyone is the authenticity of the evaluation. For one thing, quite a few business runners rely so primarily on decent scores to attract consumers that they manipulate ratings by buying positive reviews to increase traffic. In this regard, some business runners have gotten around this by offering free dishes or discounts in exchange for good scores or inviting internet celebrities to endorse them.

# Gaza’s morning ritual: Searching under rubble for dolls, books, loved ones

Gaza Strip — At the United Nations shelter in central Gaza where I live with my family, the yard and corridors outside our room are covered every night with blankets. More than 100 days since Israel launched its war on Gaza, destruction is everywhere. Israel has killed more than 24,000 people. A few days ago on a day like any other, while queueing for water – it is not clean but it is all we have – I met 63-year-old Abu Ruhmy. “They all hoped for a future outside Gaza and were waiting for the war to end to get out,” Ruhmy continued. Not any of them. All I could think of was that at some point, I would wake up, that all of this would turn out to be nothing more than a nightmare – one that had an end.” Clinics, pharmacies and medical complexes are still grappling with the destruction and the lack of medical equipment, already insufficient for the needs of the hundreds of thousands of people now needing it.

# Li urges global cooperation, vows continued opening-up at WEF

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202401/1305516.shtml
<blockquote>
In a special address at the World Economic Forum (WEF) annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Li said that China's economy is forecast to grow 5.2 percent in 2023, and that China's economy is making a steady recovery, vowing to continue to open up China's markets for global businesses, no matter how the global situation changes. The Chinese premier's emphasis on rebuilding global trust and strengthening global cooperation and remarks about the stability and openness of China's economy help inject a sense of certainty and positivity for a world that has been plagued by a severe economic downturn and rising geopolitical conflicts, experts said on Tuesday. "I think Premier Li made China's unwavering support for globalization and an open world economy very clear again at this very important international forum, in stark contrast to the de-globalization trend promoted by certain countries," Bai Ming, a research fellow at the Chinese Academy of International Trade and Economic Cooperation, told the Global Times on Tuesday. Bai noted that China's position on globalization carries great significance for a global audience that is increasingly worried about the state of the global economy and economic globalization, given China's economic size and its influence on the world economy. "It's clear that China has become a leading force in promoting economic globalization," he said. He said that Chinese economy is making steady progress, and will continue to provide a strong impetus for the world economy. And I said that the economy is being really balanced for better and stronger economic growth," Jarkas, who was in Davos, told the Global Times on Tuesday.

# Action of Japan and Australia is bringing the Asia-Pacific into danger: Global Times editorial

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202401/1305532.shtml
<blockquote>
They also mentioned increasing the sophistication and frequency of joint drills between the Self-Defense Forces and the Australian military and Tokyo has also asked for Canberra's cooperation in using Australia's vast continent as a testing ground for Japanese missiles that are under development, "apparently with China's growing maritime assertiveness in mind." The impact of this approach on the regional situation is inevitably disruptive and detrimental, poisoning the regional peace environment, intensifying tensions, and exerting significant efforts to push the Asia-Pacific region into security dilemmas or traps. It also faces the restricts of the constitution. However, the development of long-range missiles by Japan goes beyond merely "changing the rules of the game." Japan enacted a peace constitution after being defeated in World War II and pursued a principle of "exclusive self-defense," establishing an image of a "peaceful nation" and embarking on a "peaceful path" to help Japan quickly gain recognition and trust from countries affected by World War II and integrate into the international community. Medium to long-range missiles are undoubtedly significant offensive weapons. Since the intensification of global geopolitical tensions, Japan has been distorting the concept, turning regional countries' expectations for peace into tacit approval or even support for its military development.

# UK’s upper house votes to delay plan to deport asylum seekers to Rwanda

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/23/uks-upper-house-votes-to-delay-plan-to-deport-asylum-seekers-to-rwanda
<blockquote>
The United Kingdom’s upper house of parliament has voted to delay Prime Minister Rishi Sunak’s controversial plan to deport some asylum seekers to Rwanda. The chamber does not have the power to block the so-called Safety of Rwanda (Asylum and Immigration) Bill indefinitely, but could delay the legislation for up to a year. The first Rwanda-bound flight from the UK was halted in June of that year after a last-minute intervention by the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which ruled that one of the asylum seekers on board was at “real risk of irreversible harm” in the East African nation.

# How Israel has repeatedly rejected Hamas truce offers

https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2024/1/22/how-israel-has-repeatedly-rejected-hamas-truce-offers
<blockquote>
Ramallah, occupied West Bank – Israel and its Western allies have long dismissed the Gaza-based Palestinian armed group and political movement, Hamas, as illegitimate and have refused to engage with it, labelling it as a “terrorist organisation”. This narrative has become ever more apparent since October 7, when Hamas launched an attack just outside the besieged Gaza Strip on Israeli territory, killing some 1,140 people, Israeli officials said. On Sunday, Netanyahu rejected a Hamas proposal to end the war and release more than 100 captives held by the group, in exchange for a withdrawal of Israeli forces, the release of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails and recognition of Hamas governance over Gaza. Sign up Please check your email to confirm your subscription By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy protected by reCAPTCHA A timeline of Hamas truce proposals: 1988: Just one year after the group was founded, Hamas leader Mahmoud al-Zahar met the late top Israeli officials Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres, and proposed that Israel withdraw from the 1967-occupied territories in exchange for a truce. A year earlier, the Palestinian Authority (PA) had accepted the proposal of a Palestinian state comprised of the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem. 1995: Hamas again proposed a 10-year truce based on the same condition of Israeli withdrawal from occupied territories. October: After his release from Israeli prison, Hamas founder Yasin renewed the call for a ceasefire. 2003: In December, Yasin offered a ceasefire on the condition that Israel withdraw from the Palestinian territories. 2008: Hamas leader Meshaal again offered a 10-year truce, which he repeated a year later. Hamas leaders have also backed the 2002 Arab Peace Initiative that called for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from territories occupied in 1967, the right of Palestinian refugees to return to the homes they have been displaced from since 1948, and the formation of a sovereign independent Palestinian state in return for Arab recognition of Israel. “Hamas has always said that they are ready to offer a truce and to stop targeting civilians if the [Israeli] occupation removes its settlers,” Tareq Baconi, author of Hamas Contained: The Rise and Pacification of Palestinian Resistance, told Al Jazeera. “The people in Gaza are refugees. “That was their offer instead of the [1993] Oslo agreements – that they would stop armed resistance if Israel left Palestinians be in the eastern side of Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza.”

# Why is India’s Ram temple in Ayodhya controversial?

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/22/why-is-indias-ram-temple-in-ayodhya-controversial
<blockquote>
Central government offices are only open for half the day. And tens of millions of Indians are tuned into one event: the consecration of a temple to the Hindu god Ram in the city of Ayodhya. On Monday, just past noon local time, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi will join priests to inaugurate the temple, whose launch in many ways also serves as the start of his campaign to be re-elected for a third term in office in national elections due to be held between March and May. The trust in charge of the temple, whose construction is still under way, has invited an estimated 7,000 people — politicians, leading industrialists, sports stars and other public figures. But while Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government has pitched the event as a national celebration, the temple’s history is grounded in what many have dubbed one of modern India’s darkest chapters — one that has shaped the country’s politics and that cracked open deep religious fault lines in its society. Here’s a look at the tortured history of the spot where the temple is being built — and the controversies surrounding it. The temple is being built on a contentious piece of land in the northern Indian city of Ayodhya, at a spot that many Hindus believe was the birthplace of Ram, a much-worshipped god who in the religion epitomises the victory of good over evil. But until the morning of December 6, 1992, it was the Babri Masjid, a mosque built in 1528 and named after the Mughal king Babur, that stood at that place. After years of being closed to the public, in November 2019, India’s Supreme Court ruled that the site must be handed over to a trust that would be specially set up to oversee the construction of a Hindu temple. A separate piece of land in Dhannipur village on the outskirts of Ayodhya, was allocated to Muslims for a mosque that may serve as a replacement for the Babri Masjid. The court acknowledged that both the surreptitious manner in which idols were brought into the mosque in 1949 and the demolition in 1949 were crimes. Ayodhya is in India’s northern and most populous state, Uttar Pradesh. Modi’s government has also planned live screenings of the event across the country. A little more than a decade later, in the first national elections after the Babri Masjid’s demolition, it surged to become India’s single-largest party, winning 161 seats.

# ‘I no longer have a country’: Antiwar Russians who fled unlikely to return

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/22/russian-exiles-unlikely-to-return
<blockquote>
Evgeniy Kosgorov, a 38-year-old from Krasnodar, left Russia in June 2022 with his wife and a one-month-old son in his arms. Since the invasion of Ukraine, he has seen his homeland as a villainous state bound to follow the path of Nazi Germany, a country with no future and one he wanted nothing to do with. He has also been seen as someone who did not react when Russia was becoming the country it is now. I accept and understand it because what Russia is doing is wrong,” Kosgorov told Al Jazeera. “Every time I want to say that it’s difficult for the Russians who left, something inside me protests, because Ukrainians have it more difficult than us.” He donates his revenues to NGOs supporting Ukrainian refugees and has gathered a large community of like-minded people, but he knows that not everyone in Georgia welcomes the Russian arrivals; anti-Russian messages can be found graffitied on walls all around Tbilisi. Putin will not disappear from the simple fact that all these migrants who had left go back to Russia and stage a protest. According to Margarita Zavadskaya, a Finland-based political scientist who researches Russian political exiles, the latest wave of migration from Russia differs from previous instances in that it is more politicised. “People feel depressed. “The irony of the situation is that the guilt is being felt by those who are against the regime and understand the scale of the tragedy.”

# Trump may testify in E Jean Carroll defamation case: What you need to know

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/22/chk_trumpmaytestifyin-e-jean-carroll-defamation-case-heres-whats-to-know
<blockquote>
Who is E Jean Carroll and what does she accuse Trump of? E Jean Carroll testifies before Judge Lewis Kaplan as former US President Donald Trump watches, during the second civil trial where Carroll accused Trump of raping her decades ago [File: Jane Rosenberg/Reuters] She is seeking at least $10m for damage to her reputation over two statements that Trump made in June 2019, while he was president, in which he denied that anything happened and said Carroll made up the incident to boost sales of her memoir. What’s happened between 2019 and now? In 2019, Carroll filed a defamation lawsuit against Trump alleging that he labelled her a liar following the release of her memoir. Number two, it never happened. According to a report by The New York Times, Trump has not faced criminal charges for sexual assault, and such charges are not possible due to the expiration of the statute of limitations in the case involving Carroll. In contrast, in a civil case, the standard is lower, and a jury can determine liability if it believes there is a likelihood greater than 50 percent that the claim is true. “Her career has prospered, and she has been thrust back into the limelight as she always has wanted,” Habba said Judge Kaplan has ruled that if the former president takes the stand now, he won’t be allowed to say she concocted her allegation or that she was motivated by financial or political considerations.

As we near the square in Haifa, our GPS begins sending us in circles. I’m starting to feel vindicated by my choice of footwear. About 500 people showed up at the rally on Saturday [Alasdair Brenard/Al Jazeera] A local photographer explains to me that the police are not happy the protest is going ahead, that the antiwar message is not one they are ready to hear. Our guard is now up. They swoop in on the crowd and pluck a man from it, then lead him away to a nearby vehicle as the protesters, police and press surge back and forth in the confusion. It’s a brief battle before the model plane is snatched away. Meanwhile, a counter-protester films him and then tries to start arguments with the people that remain.

# What’s behind mass protests against Germany’s far-right AfD party?

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/21/whats-behind-mass-protests-against-germanys-far-right-afd-party
<blockquote>
Protests against the far-right Alternative for Germany party (AfD) are gaining momentum in the European Union nation in the wake of a report that two senior party members joined a November meeting in Berlin, where planned mass deportation of citizens of foreign origin was discussed. “Nazis, no thank you”, “It feels like 1933, AfD ban now!” and “Investigate banning AfD” read some of the banners among other slogans at protests across the country against the AfD party’s anti-immigrant stance that has rekindled Nazi-era Germany of 1930s and 40s. Thousands of people are expected to join new protests on Sunday, as German Chancellor Olaf Scholz called the protests against the far-right party “good and right”. So who are Germany’s far-right AfD and why their anti-immigrant stance has triggered countrywide mass protests? News of the gathering sent shockwaves across Germany at a time when the AfD is soaring in opinion polls, just months ahead of three major regional elections in eastern Germany where their support is strongest. What explains the rise of the AfD? The AfD is leading the polls in all three states with more than 30 percent support.

# US, UK strike eight Houthi targets over Red Sea shipping attacks

On Monday, the US and UK said they had carried out eight strikes, with support from Australia, Bahrain, Canada and the Netherlands, targeting a Houthi underground storage site as well as missile and surveillance capabilities. It said the attacks on Houthi sites were to hold the group “accountable for their illegal and unjustifiable attacks on mariners and commercial shipping” as well as to “de-escalate tensions and restore stability in the Red Sea”. Monday’s strikes came after the Houthis claimed to have conducted a successful attack on the US military cargo ship Ocean Jazz in the Gulf of Aden. The Yemeni group says the Red Sea attacks are part of their support for Palestinians who have been under attack from Israeli forces in Gaza for more than three months.

# Caught in India-Maldives spat, Lakshadweep islands want jobs, then tourists

<blockquote>
But back in Lakshadweep, many people do not want their islands caught up in a tourism tussle between India and the Maldives. Lakshadweep has 36 islands, 10 of which are inhabited. It is just one of the many concerns shaping the popular response in Lakshadweep to the prospect of tourists from India and beyond flooding their islands. Lakshadweep’s youth mostly pursue higher education in the closest mainland state, Kerala. Most Lakshadweep youth go to college on the mainland, predominantly in Kerala. A man works with copra, traditionally one of Lakshadweep’s big sources of revenue. Currently, tourism operations are active in inhabited islands such as Agatti, Kalpeni, Kavaratti, Kadmat, Minicoy, and the uninhabited island of Bangaram. All of Lakshadweep has only about 100 hotel rooms. The Maldives, on the other hand, has more than 1,000 resorts and hotels, many of them among the most exclusive holiday destinations in the world. “This is a union territory, and we have no elected government; hence it is very easy to implement their agendas,” he said. Prime Minister Modi wants more tourists to visit the islands, but locals have concerns [Salahuddin/Al Jazeera] ‘How can he clean beaches by firing cleaners?’ “If they have such intentions, they would have rolled out a tourism policy that promotes employability,” he said. “Even though the administrator is saying that he is cleaning the islands, it is not true,” said Abdul Salam from Kiltan island, who coordinated the legal fight for the payment of pending wages to the fired sanitation workers.

# Embracing One-China principle 'inevitable trend of times' as Tuvalu reportedly mulls severing 'ties' with Taiwan

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202401/1305848.shtml
<blockquote>
Embracing the One-China principle is the general trend of the times and the inevitable choice of the international community, Chinese experts said on Monday, after a Tuvalu envoy's recent remarks that the Pacific island country may follow Nauru's decision to sever "ties" with the island of Taiwan. The Tuvalu envoy's remarks came after Nauru, another Pacific Island nation, announced it was severing "diplomatic ties" with Taiwan on January 15, on the heels of the secessionist Democratic Progressive Party (DPP)'s Lai Ching-te's victory in the regional leader election in the island on January 13 this year. The DPP authorities are relying more on US and Australian efforts in pressing PICs to maintain "diplomatic ties" with Taiwan, but the vast majority of its handful of "allies" recognize their true national interests, which makes the trend [of cutting ties with the island of Taiwan] unstoppable, Xin told the Global Times.

# Biden vs Trump more of a certainty as DeSantis drops out of presidential race; ‘2024 election to further tear US apart’

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202401/1305859.shtml
<blockquote>
Analysts said this further secures Trump's bid to become GOP nominee to run against Joe Biden this year, as US media had seen DeSantis as Trump's biggest threat in the Republican primaries. In the past, pro-establishment elites may have wanted to separate Trump from Republicans by supporting younger politicians like DeSantis, as they are concerned that Trump will lose his qualification to run in the presidential election due to a series of legal issues. This will make the 2024 election unprecedentedly fierce and the "Biden vs Trump 2.0" will further tear the US apart, experts noted. DeSantis touted his support for Trump by saying that "while I've had disagreements with Donald Trump, such as on the Coronavirus pandemic and his elevation of Anthony Fauci, Trump is superior to the current incumbent Joe Biden. Trump on Sunday touted the recent endorsements he has received from his rivals among Republicans. At present, the vast majority of Democrats and Republicans consider a victory by the other party to be a threat to US democracy, which means that the presidential election at the end of 2024 is a "zero-sum game" or "a life-and-death matter for US democracy," while many swing voters or those who refuse to vote find that both Trump and Biden will disappoint them, said analysts. But it seems that playing "the anti-China card" can't help them to distinguish themselves from each other, as the most important issues that win them support from voters are more about economic policies, immigration policies and their personal charisma, said Xin. For US politicians, being hawkish toward China might not set them apart from their rivals or make them more popular, and when they take office, they will find that the US must cooperate with China to deal with many challenges.

# Integration of Chinese Ancient Books project vital to maintain inheritance

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202401/1305816.shtml
<blockquote>
In 2017, the Integration of Chinese Ancient Books project was initiated, aiming to comprehensively survey the status of ancient Chinese texts held abroad and conduct comprehensive research on versions and varieties missing from China. With the participation of over 300 academic teams and more than 1,000 experts and scholars, the International Sinological Research Center of Shandong University plays a central role in this colossal endeavor. The decision to start with the "Zi" section has historical significance for the university as Professor Zheng Jiewen has since been named the leading researcher in charge of delving deeper into the study and researches. The meticulous efforts of experts in cross-referencing information from domestic and international ancient Chinese texts have led to the identification of nearly 1,900 rare Chinese classics missing from China. Three databases for the documented texts are currently in development: The Global Chinese Ancient Texts Catalog Database, the Overseas Chinese Ancient Texts Full-Text Image Database and the Database of Chinese Classics and Sinology Research Publications. "The exhibitions will showcase rare Chinese classics missing in China, emphasizing the documentary, cultural and artistic value of overseas ancient Chinese texts," Zheng said.

Chinese officials vowed on Monday to fully implement a recently released development plan for the "silver economy," or the eldercare industry, to cope with an aging population and foster new economic growth drivers. "Actively coping with the aging population is related to the overall development of the country, the well-being of hundreds of millions of people, and is closely related to everyone and every family," Zhang Shixin, a deputy secretary-general of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the top economic planning agency, told a press conference in Beijing on Monday. Li Yongxin, an official from the Ministry of Civil Affairs, said that the ministry will work to increase the supply of eldercare services, including nursing homes in rural areas, while fostering new service models and nurturing talent for the eldercare industry.

# Maestro baritone Liao Changyong pioneers efforts in elevating Chinese art songs worldwide

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202401/1305879.shtml
<blockquote>
Liao Changyong performs during his Chinese art song concert in Geneva in January 2019. Listening to his Chinese songs, you will be captivated by his pure and emotionally charged voice that connects you with history and culture. This is Liao Changyong, Asia's premier baritone. Liao Changyong Photo: Courtesy of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music Liao, adorned with awards such as first prize at the International Singing Competition of Toulouse and the top spot in the Operalia, one of the most prestigious opera competitions in the world, has had an illustrious career. Fate, however, played a discordant note early on when his father's untimely passing left the family grappling with an unexpected burden. It was during these challenging times that Liao's love for music blossomed. Simultaneously performing, he extended invitations on behalf of the Shanghai Conservatory of Music to those artists who had "drifted away" overseas, successfully persuading some to return. The return of exceptional artists is steering China's musical culture toward a path of international dissemination. "The Chinese music that people abroad genuinely appreciate should be inseparable from China's outstanding traditional culture," Liao told the Global Times. In recent years, Liao has successfully organized several concerts themed "Chinese art songs in 100 years," showcasing Chinese art songs from the 1920s and 1930s, as well as contemporary pieces. Earlier initiatives in the overseas exchange of art songs, such as the promotion of Chinese art songs at the United Nations headquarters in Geneva and an exclusive New Year's music concert held in Vienna during the Chinese New Year, have garnered considerable attention worldwide. He hopes that through Chinese art songs, more international friends will develop an appreciation for Chinese poetry, classical culture, and that the repertoire of foreign musicians will also include works from China. Indeed, China's history, unbroken for over 5,000 years, should be nurtured carefully, with a particular emphasis on preserving its exceptional traditional culture. This, undoubtedly, is a splendid endeavor for the enrichment of our cultural tapestry, Liao noted. His story makes him one of the most fitting spokespersons for the determined spirit of the Chinese people, unafraid of hardships and willing to strive for their dreams.

# GT investigates: Evidences, sources prove India 'supports terrorism' in Pakistan's Balochistan

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202401/1305842.shtml
<blockquote>
Pakistani officials told media that India's intelligence agency, the Research & Analysis Wing, was involved in the incident. While continually suppressing some of its rivals and neighbors in the international community with the excuse of anti-terrorism, India has secretly funded terrorist forces in Pakistan, in various parts of the South Asian country, such as its separatist-plagued Balochistan, inciting local secessionists to undermine regional stability through terrorist attacks, they revealed. Through looking into historical materials and related news reports from both Pakistani and Indian media sources, as well as speaking with sources and observers who are familiar with the situation in Balochistan, the Global Times found that India has a long history of backing terrorism in Pakistan. In December 2023, a commander of the Baloch National Army (BNA) separatist militant group, who had surrendered himself to the Pakistani government, disclosed that India has been secretly supporting terrorist activities in Balochistan and financing separatist forces in the region. "We have had the evidence long before," the source told the Global Times. He said that he was "100 percent" sure that India has been funding the terrorist forces in Balochistan. "China firmly opposes double standard in counterterrorism," noted Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Mao Ning at a press conference on December 27, 2023, while responding to a question asking about its comments on then-recent media reports, which said that the surrendered BNA commander disclosed that India has been secretly supporting terrorist activities in Balochistan. However, these projects became a target of some terrorist forces in Pakistan, who "believe that if they can hurt the Chinese nationals in Pakistan through terrorism, the BRI and CPEC projects can be compromised," Moiz Farooq, executive editor of Pakistan-based Daily Ittehad Medis Group, told the Global Times. Trying to split and destabilize Pakistan is the main purpose behind India's backing of terrorism in regions like Balochistan, said Liu Zongyi, director of the Center for South Asia Studies at the Shanghai Institutes for International Studies. Balochistan is a key region of the CPEC, Liu said. "India supports separatism and terrorism in Balochistan and other regions in Pakistan, so as to weaken both Pakistan and China," he told the Global Times. To help maintain regional stability in some Pakistani areas, apart from the current anti-terrorism cooperation, China has made great efforts to support local economic and social development, and improve the living standards of the people there, trying hard to eliminate the root causes of terrorism and separatism at the source, Liu said.

# Foreigners living in, visiting China pick up in 2023 as they share real China to dispel misperceptions

Immigration organs across China issued 711,000 resident permits for foreigners in 2023 and the number of foreign citizens living in China has recovered to 85 percent of 2019 levels, according to a press briefing of the National Immigration Administration (NIA).

# Lai advised to thoroughly understand cross-Straits reality and overall trend: Global Times editorial

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202401/1305877.shtml
<blockquote>
Two days after the announcement of the election results for the 2024 leadership in the Taiwan region, the government of the Pacific island nation Nauru declared its recognition of the one-China principle, severing the so-called "diplomatic relations" with the Taiwan authorities and seeking to reestablish diplomatic relations with China. This reflects that the DPP does not represent the mainstream public opinion on the island, and 60 percent of Taiwan's population does not endorse the DPP. Even the US is well aware of this. The elections will not change the basic landscape and development trend of cross-Straits relations, will not alter the shared aspiration of compatriots across the Taiwan Straits to forge closer ties, and will not impede the inevitable trend of China's reunification. Otherwise, in the next four years, the situation in the Taiwan Straits will be difficult to stabilize, and Lai's team will be leading Taiwan into a precarious and unpredictable future. Acceptance of the "1992 Consensus" is a prerequisite, and any explanation for non-acceptance is merely an excuse and a self-exposure of "Taiwan independence."

# Blinken kicks off Africa trip, but US 'may be too overwhelmed with crises' to stabilize West Africa

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202401/1305849.shtml
<blockquote>
One purpose of Blinken's visit is to evaluate the implementation of the US-Africa Summit in December 2022 in African countries, as Nigeria is a key country for the US in Africa, and Angola is involved in the Lobito Corridor project, Shen Xiaolei, an associate research fellow at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing, told the Global Times on Monday. The second is to discuss the security situation in West Africa and the Sahel region. However, experts believed that given the escalating situation in the Middle East, particularly the worsening Red Sea crisis, the US no longer has the capability to stabilize West Africa. African development requires comprehensive cooperation with countries around the world, and as African countries gain more strategic autonomy, they have the ability to choose better cooperation partners and will not easily align themselves with any particular side, Shen noted.

# Could a divided Jewish base upend US Democrats’ presidential hopes?

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/22/could-a-divided-jewish-base-upend-us-democrats-presidential-hopes
<blockquote>
She also heard Israeli comments about Palestinians that made her uncomfortable: “They were alluded to as being dangerous.” Now, as Israel’s war in Gaza continues to rage, Jewish American voters such as Kornberg are grappling with the US’s role in the conflict — and how it will affect their voting preferences in the upcoming presidential election. Kornberg, a member of the progressive organisation Jewish Voice for Peace (JVP), is among those protesting Biden’s stance on the war in Gaza, where United Nations experts have warned of the risk of genocide and famine. In recent months, Kornberg has travelled from Michigan to Washington, DC, and Chicago to join demonstrations calling for a ceasefire. “I’m just not convinced that the fear of Trump is going to be enough to get [Democratic voters] to go to the polls,” Kornberg said. President Joe Biden has rallied support among the majority of Jewish voters, but younger voters are more sceptical of his track record in Gaza [Manuel Balce Ceneta/AP Photo] A poll in November from the Jewish Electorate Institute found that Biden retains strong Jewish support overall: Three-quarters of participants approved of his handling of Israel’s war in Gaza. Only 53 percent of Jewish voters ages 18 to 35 approved of Biden’s stance, compared with 82 percent for other voting age groups. “Overwhelmingly, Jewish voters support President Biden because he represents the interests and values of the Jewish community, including — but not limited to — support of Israel,” Soifer told Al Jazeera. “We now have over 1.8 million followers on our social media accounts and over 720,000 people that JVP counts as our base. In 2022, for example, AIPAC and Democratic Majority for Israel spent more than $6m — an unprecedented amount — on an attack ad campaign against Donna Edwards, a progressive candidate for the US House of Representatives.

# Antigua and Barbuda PM's visit injects impetus into China-LAC cooperation

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202401/1305852.shtml
<blockquote>
Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda Gaston Browne arrived in Beijing on Monday for his weeklong China visit, marking the first by a leader from Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region in 2024. The Caribbean country, a long-time China partner which faces great challenge of post-pandemic recovery, hopes to ride the tide of the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to leverage its economy and become a gateway of China cooperation in the Caribbean region, analysts said on Monday. They believe Browne's visit, against the backdrop of Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi's recent visit to LAC region following the routine New Year African tour by a Chinese foreign minister, highlighted the trend of enhanced China-LAC exchanges, which lead not only to deepening mutual trust but also to extensive development opportunities. Establishing diplomatic ties with China within two years after its 1981 independence from the UK, Antigua and Barbuda has always been a firm supporter of China's core interests, including the Taiwan question. Pan believes China-Antigua and Barbuda relationship, with their sound development, could set an example for other countries in the LAC region. Noticing Browne's destinations include Zhejiang and Shanghai, Wang Youming, director of the Institute of Developing Countries at the China Institute of International Studies in Beijing, told the Global Times on Monday that more and more leaders of developing countries chose to visit, in addition to Beijing, China's economic and technology hubs to enrich the channels of mutual exchanges and learn from China's development experience.

# Competition-driven approach, geopolitical calculations won’t bolster US influence in Africa

<blockquote>
He is expected to visit Cape Verde, Cote d'Ivoire, Nigeria and Angola, in an attempt to prove "the US is a key partner on a continent where China and Russia have exerted their influence," as reported by the CNN on Sunday. Song Wei, a professor from the School of International Relations and Diplomacy at Beijing Foreign Studies University, believes this shows Washington routinely views Africa from the perspective of competition. As the US' engagement with Africa is driven by a zero-sum mentality and self-interest, it is difficult for Washington to comprehend the Chinese approach - it is both courteous and pragmatic diplomacy for China to prioritize Africa as the destination for the Chinese foreign minister's first overseas trip of the year and maintain its commitment to the continent. The US has its own infrastructure schemes for Africa, but everyone can sense the implication of competition. "This is the biggest difference from the respect that China shows Africa," said Huang.

# China’s metal export curbs not ‘retaliation, but in line with global norm:’ analysts

<blockquote>
China's gallium exports fell 66 percent year-on-year to $8.47 million last year, while those of germanium edged down 8.2 percent to $48.42 million, data from Chinese customs showed, a trend that industry observers said reflected multiple factors - including market demand adjustment, soaring material prices as well as certain time needed for application reviews after metal export controls took effect. Also, a gain in germanium exports to the US last year provided fresh evidence that Chinese authorities were not "weaponizing the curbs" to target any individual country, observers said. In accordance with international practice, China has the right to protect its legitimate interests," Ma Jihua, a veteran industry analyst, told the Global Times on Monday. Mao Ning, a spokesperson of the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said at a press briefing in July that it is an international common practice for a country to implement export controls on relevant items in accordance with the law, and it does not target any specific country.

# Pakistan ex-PM’s party loses election symbol. Will it hurt its prospects?

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/23/pakistan-ex-pms-party-loses-election-symbol-will-it-hurt-its-prospects
<blockquote>
Bhutto claimed the Election Commission of Pakistan (ECP) acted under pressure from former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, who has been accused of cutting a deal with the country’s military that controls most levers of power from behind the scenes. An intra-party election conducted by the PTI on June 8, 2022 was not recognised by the ECP on the grounds that it was not “just and fair”. An attempt by the PTI to get the ban overturned failed as Pakistan’s Supreme Court last week upheld the election commission’s decision, which is significant to the PTI because it is reminiscent of Khan’s success as a former cricketer. Nadia Malik, Head of Geo Television’s election cell, says that intra-party elections are a farce in Pakistan but the ECP did not hold other parties accountable, letting them scot-free. “Losing a symbol is not something new in Pakistan but PTI can not even choose a different symbol for all their candidates,” as the deadline for that has passed, Malik told Al Jazeera. To counter the confusion that this can create, the party’s social media team is working on a portal that allows voters to search for names and symbols of PTI’s candidates, Malik added. “The end result of the ECP’s decision, and the Supreme Court’s ludicrous affirmation of it, is the disenfranchisement of millions of voters and the liquidation of the country’s largest party in the run-up to the polls,” Asad Rahim Khan, a constitutional expert, said. However, the bat was not the party’s first symbol. After the 1977 general election, the military government of General Zia-ul-Haq deleted several electoral symbols from the approved list of symbols, the scales being one of them. Malik, the journalist from GEO, pointed out that around 40 percent of Pakistan’s population is uneducated and voters who can not read rely on symbols to identify the party they want to choose on the ballot. The PML-N tiger Malik said PML-N was unable to use the bicycle symbol. Its tiger symbol was barred over its failure to elect a new party chief after Sharif was dismissed as prime minister for his involvement in the Panama Papers scandal. However, in 2018, Bhutto’s grandson, Bhutto-Zardari, won a legal battle against a PPP breakaway faction to get the sword back.

# Supreme Court allows federal agents to cut razor wire at US-Mexico border

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/1/23/supreme-court-allows-federal-agents-to-cut-razor-wire-at-us-mexico-border
<blockquote>
The United States Supreme Court has ruled that Border Patrol agents may resume cutting a razor wire fence that Texas installed on its border with Mexico to deter migrants and asylum seekers from entering the country. The 5-4 ruling on Monday was a victory for the administration of US President Joe Biden, issued in the midst of an ongoing legal battle that saw a federal appeals court force agents to stop cutting the fence last month. For more than two years, the Republican governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, has sought to bar migrants and asylum seekers from entering the US, unspooling razor wire that extends over 46km (30 miles) of its border with Mexico along the banks of the Rio Grande river and has left people injured and bloodied. Border control has historically been the legal domain of the federal government. Operation Lone Star, launched in 2021 with significant public support, pushes the legal boundaries of what a state can do to control immigration.

# US keeps hyping military tension around Taiwan Straits

https://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202401/1305916.shtml
<blockquote>
A US think tank released a report on Tuesday claiming that the "majority of experts" from the US and the island of Taiwan said they believe "a crisis in the Taiwan Straits is likely in 2024," with a "blockade" or "quarantine" of the island by the Chinese mainland seen as the most likely scenario, while analysts from the mainland said this is an old trick of the US to hype regional tensions to spread fear in the region to serve its hegemonic interests. After the Taiwan regional election which concluded on January 13, there have not been military tensions around the region so far, but the US is planning to send a bipartisan congress delegation to encourage secessionists on the island, and US aircraft carriers are also approaching the region, according to the US Naval Institute. Li Haidong, a professor at the China Foreign Affairs University, told the Global Times on Tuesday that "The US needs tensions and fears among the region to force its allies in the region to stand closer with it and push other countries to take sides and rely on the US. The combination of the Type 075 amphibious assault ship and the Type 071 amphibious landing ship have strong island-seizing capability, and they can join forces with aircraft carrier groups as well as other warships and warplanes to form tremendous joint combat capabilities in an island-seizing mission, Song said. Since August 2022, the PLA has organized three major island blockade exercises around the island of Taiwan as countermeasures to US-Taiwan collusion, and displayed its capability in conducting precision strikes to paralyze key military installations on the island of Taiwan, seizing air superiority and control of the sea, as well as stopping "Taiwan independence" secessionists from escaping and external military forces from interfering.
