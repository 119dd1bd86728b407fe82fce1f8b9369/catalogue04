    "text": "When Salman Rushdie's fourth novel, \"The Satanic Verses,\" appeared in its English-language first edition on September 26, 1988, the writer could not yet have imagined that this book would fundamentally change his life.\n\nNow, nearly 34 years later, numerous festivals and literary associations have invited people to solidarity readings — not to mark this year's anniversary, but because of the assassination attempt against Rushdie decades after Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa calling for the author's murder in February 1989. \n\n\"The Satanic Verses\" was first published in Britain, then in the United States, Italy and France. Muslims quickly protested against the novel and its author. South Africa, India and Pakistan stopped the import of the book; people ended up dying during demonstrations.\n\nIn London, where Rushdie was living at the time, there were also violent protests, arson attacks and threats against bookstores selling the novel.\n\nRushdie's story is about two Indian actors who survive a plane crash. One becomes an archangel; the other resembles the devil. The title of the novel refers to two verses that are said to have been whispered to the Prophet Muhammad by Satan and therefore erased from the Koran.\n\n\"The Satanic Verses\" in German\n\nIn fact, Rushdie's novel is not a critique of Islam, but a narrative about postcolonialism and migration. Rushdie later said that he never wanted to insult Islam. He could have done that in five minutes instead of working on a book for five years, he said.\n\nAlmost half a year after the novel's publication, Khomeini issued a fatwa, or Islamic legal opinion, calling on all Muslims to kill the British-Indian writer for alleged blasphemy. Rushdie immediately went into hiding, living in secrecy and under personal protection for nine years.\n\n'Fatwa led to paralysis' for German publisher\n\nKhomeini directed the death call not only against Rushdie, but against everyone involved in the publication of the novel.\n\nA quarter of a year earlier, Reinhold Neven DuMont, then head of publishing at Kiepenheuer & Witsch, had acquired the book rights for the German-language market. He later describes it as his biggest mistake not to have read the complete manuscript in advance — not because of the impending danger itself, but because he had thus not seen it coming.\n\n\"The fatwa led to paralysis in the publishing house,\" Helge Malchow, editor at the time and later publishing director, told DW. Some of the staff wanted to drop publication, if with a heavy heart, because of the life-threatening situation. \"Others wanted to defend artistic freedom and publish the book,\" he recalled.\n\nThe translator who had already been commissioned halted the project, and Kiepenheuer & Witsch refrained from the planned publication for the time being.\n\nPublic criticism of the dithering attitude was gathering steam, but Malchow cautioned that \"it was the first Islamist threat of this kind, and it caught us completely unawares.\"\n\nPublished in taz newspaper\n\nArno Widmann, co-founder of Germany's left-wing taz daily, told DW that he saw things differently.\n\n\"I thought it was a crime not to publish the book,\" he said. \n\nGerman writer Hans Magnus Enzensberger turned to Widmann's friend Frank Berberich, publisher of the culture magazine Lettre International. Enzensberger suggested Berberich print excerpts from Rushdie's book there.\n\nBut the idea was dropped because of the magazine's quarterly publication cycle. Berberich suggested printing excerpts in taz.\n\n\"I thought it was a crime not to publish the book,\" Arno Widmann said\n\nWidmann severely criticized the German publishing industry in several articles at the time. He said Germany was hiding while other countries were standing up for freedom of expression, and that these publishers were not intimidated by the protests. \n\nSo, when taz went ahead and printed the excerpts, as expected \"we received too little attention,\" Widmann said.\n\nAssassinations and brutal attacks \n\nDespite the clamorous criticism of the publishing decision, the concerns turned out to be well-founded. In July 1991, the Italian translator Ettore Capriolo survived a knife attack in Milan with serious injuries. A few days later, Hitoshi Igarashi, a Japanese translator and Islamic scholar, was stabbed to death by one or more unknown persons in front of his office at the University of Tsukuba.\n\nJamshid Khasani, who had translated \"The Satanic Verses\" into Farsi, fled Tehran in 1992 via several countries to Israel, where he settled under a new name.\n\nAfter the Turkish writer Aziz Nesin announced that he would publish excerpts from Rushdie's book, Islamists carried out an arson attack on a culture festival in 1993 because Nesin was scheduled to be there. Nesin managed to escape, but 37 people died. That same year in Oslo the book's Norwegian publisher, William Nygaard, was shot three times, an attack he survived.\n\nDecades later, on August 12, 2022, Rushdie himself survived an assassination attempt, though was seriously injured. He was on artificial respiration for a time and will suffer permanent damage.\n\nAfter years in hiding and under police protection, Rushdie has described living in New York freely and without concern for his life.\n\nPlay Video\nSalman Rushdie - A marked man\nPublishing house for just one book\n\nBack in 1989, about 100 publishing houses, writers' associations, editors and authors got together to found a new publishing house that would publish \"The Satanic Verses\" in German. The idea was that no publishing house should be the sole target of possible retaliatory attacks. Kiepenheuer & Witsch was responsible for printing and distribution.\n\nThe Article 19 publishing house, whose name refers to the freedom of expression in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, served the sole purpose of publishing Rushdie's novel. The collective donated the profits of the sales to the PEN writers' association for the benefit of persecuted authors.\n\nRushdie was not happy about the collective solution; he would have preferred his publisher to take an unequivocal stance. \"He was downright outraged,\" Helge Malchow remembered, adding the writer felt the decision was like backing off from the threat.\n\nOn October 17, 1989, \"The Satanic Verses\" hit the German-language market. To this day, the person who translated the novel has not been publicly identified.\n\nBernhard Robben, translator\n\n'Concentrated hatred'\n\nBernhard Robben, who later translated several of Rushdie's works into German, told DW that, as much as he would have liked to translate the book, he struggled with the idea of living \"in fear of death.\" \n\nThe translator had met Rushdie earlier through a mutual friend, the British writer Ian McEwan. Robben was living in Oxford at the time and he and Rushdie met and got along well. But then Rushdie had to go into hiding.\n\nAfter the fatwa was announced, Robben finally agreed to translate \"The Satanic Verses.\" He recalls friends were aghast. He told them \"I can't not do it.\" \n\nIt was unthinkable to him that this book would not be published in German and that the attack on freedom of expression would succeed.\n\nIn the end, the publishing collective decided to have several translators work simultaneously so that publication would not be delayed.\n\nIn his 2012 memoir, \"Joseph Anton\" — his alias under police protection — Rushdie speculates that \"The Satanic Verses\" would not find a publisher today because the risk of attacks is greater today than back then. \n\nBernhard Robben, who co-translated \"Joseph Anton,\" is in fact \"pretty sure it wouldn't be published today.\"\n\nPEN: NO FREEDOM FOR THE WORD\nSalman Rushdie\n\nThe British-Indian author quickly earned the ire of Iran's Ayatollah after publishing his book \"Satanic Verses\" in 1988. The book makes several references to figures in Christianity and Islam, leading Ayatollah Khomeini to issue a fatwa against the writer and calling on Muslims all over the world to kill him. The book's Japanese translator was assasinated in 1991.\n\n\n\n\nThis article was originally written in German.",

Though several WSL clubs have sold out their season tickets for games that are, for the most part, at much smaller stadiums, there is a suggestion that some fans buy them to secure a few key games in a season and won't necessarily attend every match. \"I think we've now entered that phase of women's football becoming a business,\" said the head coach of WSL champions Chelsea, Emma Hayes, after the Euros win. \"The next step is the league leaving the FA and going to the Premier League or an independent body and that there is a vision around the women's game so we don't just have single big moments – single events once every two years or once a year – that they're every week.\" For now though, with the exception of a handful of clubs in Spain, France and Germany, it's clear the combination of money, better facilities and bigger crowds have made the WSL the destination of choice for the world's best players. \"We can now start pushing in that competition as a league, WSL, in the Champions League,\" said Williamson to DW before Arsenal snuck past Ajax and in to the group stage. \"And from our perspective that's where we should be.\"",

    "text": "For Leah Williamson, beating your biggest rivals in front of tens of thousands is becoming a habit. Two months after lifting Euro 2022 in front of 87,192 people at Wembley, she was reflecting on the impressive crowd of 47,367 that had seen Arsenal ease to a 4-0 win over Spurs 15 kilometers across London at The Emirates Stadium at the end of September.\n\n\"I think it [a rise in attendances] was on its way before COVID hit and set us back a little bit again. But now these are the people that are interested in watching, those people are fans of the game and they will come to watch us again and again and again, I hope,\" she told DW, before striking a slightly more cautious note.\n\n\"It's just got to be at the right time and that's when the sustainability of the game comes in. I question it because it has to be fixture-friendly with the men's team and there's a lot of things [to fall in to place for] a day like today.\"\n\n\n\n\nThose things are increasingly starting to happen in England. That weekend, September 24 and 25, also saw the Merseyside derby between Liverpool and Everton played in front of 27,574, meaning two of the league's top four attendances were recorded in consecutive days. Tickets for England's friendly against the USA at Wembley on October 7 sold out in less than 24 hours. Demand is clear.\n\nPay but stay away\n\nBut a somewhat unforeseen effect of affordable tickets and increased demand has been empty seats at sold out games. Nearly 6,000 people, or 11%, who bought tickets for the north London derby didn't turn up to the game itself. Empty seats in sold out stadiums were also noticeable in the Euros.\n\nThough several WSL clubs have sold out their season tickets for games that are, for the most part, at much smaller stadiums, there is a suggestion that some fans buy them to secure a few key games in a season and won't necessarily attend every match.\n\nNevertheless, the signs from a crowd perspective have been encouraging in the early part of the season, with the two bumper crowds pushing the average up to near 10,000. That will inevitably drop once fewer games are played at the bigger stadiums but crowds, in general, are up. Sustaining that is, as ever, a tougher proposition.\n\nAs Williamson suggested, crowds spiked after England reached the semifinals of World Cup 2019 only for COVID to intervene. With a World Cup following next July, there may never be a better chance to get it right.\n\nThe biggest driver of progress in England has been the increasing willingness of clubs and the country's Football Association (FA) to spend on the women's game. With Liverpool now back in the WSL after underfunding their side for years, and Manchester United finally catching up after similar levels of neglect, all the Premier League's big sides are seeing the value of their women's teams.\n\nChelsea's Sam Kerr is one of the world's best paid female players\n\nIn truth, the gulf between the genders means funding a top women's team only takes about 1% of the budget of a men's side like United, Manchester City, Chelsea or Arsenal, and the contributions don't count towards UEFA financial fair play rules. But even that 1% is out of reach for clubs outside the elite, meaning the WSL is increasingly beginning to resemble the Premier League – only rock-bottom Reading don't have a top flight men's side behind them.\n\nEmma Hayes wants Premier League takeover \n\n\"I think we've now entered that phase of women's football becoming a business,\" said the head coach of WSL champions Chelsea, Emma Hayes, after the Euros win. \"The next step is the league leaving the FA and going to the Premier League or an independent body and that there is a vision around the women's game so we don't just have single big moments – single events once every two years or once a year – that they're every week.\"\n\nThe WSL has already begun to act more like a big business, signing multi-million pound domestic broadcasting deals with Sky and the BBC and an overseas contract with DAZN that will put rival European leagues even further behind financially. While there's little doubt that the hyper-capitalist model of the Premier League is the way to bring in more money, there are some long-term questions over whether the WSL wants a system where only money really talks.\n\nFor now though, with the exception of a handful of clubs in Spain, France and Germany, it's clear the combination of money, better facilities and bigger crowds have made the WSL the destination of choice for the world's best players.\n\n\"It's really impressive how it's progressed since the Euros.\" Arsenal's Austrian international defender Laura Wienroither told DW. \"I feel like in general, in WSL the quality is a lot better. And also what's happening around social media stuff and publicity.\"\n\nChampions League elusive for English clubs\n\nBut it seems the positivity about playing in England is not so strong at one of its biggest clubs. Manchester City should have benefited more than most from the increased marketability of England's win, but they lost starters Lucy Bronze and world-record sale Keira Walsh to Barcelona, Georgia Stanway to Bayern Munich and Ellen White, Jill Scott and reserve keeper Karen Bardsley to retirement. Caroline Weir, another summer departure, knocked City out of the Champions League playoffs for Real Madrid.\n\nEnglish clubs have failed to wrestle the Champions League from Lyon and the rest\n\nWith City's Abu Dhabi owners ensuring money is no object at the club, such an exodus is puzzling and rumors that head coach Gareth Taylor is not widely respected by the players increased after a shock opening day defeat to Aston Villa followed that loss to Real.\n\nThe absence of Champions League football will hurt City's reputation if not their income. And that competition remains the final frontier for the WSL. Arsenal are the only side to have won it back in 2007, four years before the WSL was formed and almost a decade before the league went professional.\n\n\"We can now start pushing in that competition as a league, WSL, in the Champions League,\" said Williamson to DW before Arsenal snuck past Ajax and in to the group stage. \"And from our perspective that's where we should be.\"\n\nThe group stage draw on Monday means they will have to push pretty hard to make their mark. Arsenal were drawn with holders Lyon and Italian champions Juventus while Chelsea will face rising powers Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid. For all the hype and goodwill, the WSL will also be judged by how well it fares against Europe's best.\n\nEdited by: Kyle McKinnon",

The icons of the new wave scene still have a place in the hearts of fans around the world, decades after their rise to fame in the 1980s.\n\nThe band's remaining permanent members, guitarist and keyboardist Martin Gore and lead singer Dave Gahan, announced in Berlin on October 4 that they will release a new album \"towards the end of March\" and embark on a world tour.\n\nThe band had been recording their latest album in Santa Barbara and will soon return to New York to finish it.\n\nGahan said they had \"a really good time together doing it\" and had started writing a couple years ago, before the passing of founding keyboardist Andy Fletcher, aka \"Fletch,\" who died at his home on May 26 after an aortic dissection, in which a tear occurs in the inner layer of the body's main artery.\n\n Band member remembered\n\n\"I think that it's important to say that all the songs and album title were decided before Andy passed. The album title is 'Memento Mori,' which means 'remember that you must die,'\" said Gore, who has long been the band's main songwriter. \"And it sounds very morbid, but I think you can look at it very positively, as well — Like: Live each day to the max. I think that's how we like to interpret it, too.\"\n\nGore (left) and Gahan (center) pay tribute to departed bandmate Andy Fletcher (right)\n\nGahan said that, when he heard the title, he \"liked it immediately,\" acknowledging that it took on another meaning with Fletcher gone. \"As you perform them even over years, songs always take on different forms depending on what's going on in your personal life or what's going on in the world,\" he said.\n\nThe singer said they often missed Fletch while recording in the studio. \"Many times we would joke and things would come up and of course we missed Fletch … those are the things you miss about someone, the things you kind of take for granted when they are there.\"\n\nThe band will go on a world tour in 2023, starting with a limited run of shows in North America, followed by stadium tours next summer. Prestigious venues on the schedule include New York City's Madison Square Garden and London's Twickenham Stadium, among others.\n\nDepeche Mode got their start in the 1980s\n\nA boy band with a future\n\nThe group formed in Basildon, Essex, in England in 1980. The combination of the velvety voice of Dave Gahan with lyrics full of guilt and anguish penned by Martin Gore turned out to be a winning collaboration.\n\nYet, in their early years, the band was dismissed as synth-pop pinups: a boy band that was unlikely to last. Andy Fletcher told British paper The National years ago that Depeche Mode's original accountant only drew up a three-year financial plan, thinking the band wouldn't last any longer.\n\nThe 1981 album \"Speak & Spell,\" which spawned the hits \"New Life\" and \"Just Can't Get Enough\" and featured plenty of danceable synth melodies, put Depeche Mode at the center of the British new wave scene. \n\nDepeche Mode then went on to sell more than 100 million albums, winning over a global audience with hit singles such as \"Personal Jesus,\" \"People Are People\" or \"Enjoy The Silence.\"\n\nThe band's last studio album, \"Spirit,\" came out in 2017.\n\nIn 2020, Depeche Mode was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nThe band has also inspired a number of covers by artists one might not expect, such as Johnny Cash and Marilyn Manson. \n\n10 DEPECHE MODE COVERS BY FAMOUS SINGERS OR BANDS\nDepeche Mode\n\nIn the late 80s and early 90s, the British synthpop band offered the world a number of notable hits.

After all, fans had already gotten used to other synth-heavy German bands like Tangerine Dream and Kraftwerk.\n\nIn 1984, \"People are People\" was used as the theme song for Germany's TV coverage of the Summer Olympics, which helped make it a hit.\n\nApparently the band was so popular with German magazine Bravo and its TV affiliate that the publication would make up stories when an interview was refused, according to a BBC report.\n\nSpeaking to an NME journalist in West Germany in 1984, Andy Fletcher said: \"The last time we refused an interview with them, they made up a story about Dave having to be carried off stage at the end of every performance, taken to a separate dressing room and kept supplied with constant fluids. The time before that they said we hated everyone under 20.\"\n\nAndy Fletcher died suddenly in May 2022\n\nDuring the Berlin press conference on October 4, Gore and Gahan were asked how they view the role of music in light of the ongoing wars in Europe and a world in turmoil. \"It sometimes feels a bit strange to be able to do this,\" Gahan said, \"but to be able to walk on a stage and bring some joy to a lot of people is something that we are pretty proud of.”\n\nAs for the upcoming tour, the band members said they were mulling plans for a tribute to Fletcher. \"For sure he'll be there in spirit — or, you know, judging us,\" Gahan laughed.\n\nEdited by: Elizabeth Grenier",

At the same time, climate protection remains one of the key challenges of our time.

Chiang lost and took refuge in the island of Taiwan. For some time after that, Taiwan was the center of propaganda from both sides. The CPC wanted to \"liberate\" Taiwan, while Kuomintang wanted to \"recapture the mainland.\"\n\n\n\n\n\"There is little appetite in Berlin for a forward-leaning approach to Taiwan that might be seen as provocative in Beijing,\" he underlined.\n\n\"I do not see this visit by members of parliament as a sign that the German government's approach has changed in any fundamental way.

    "text": "Pictures of dead wild birds' carcasses, people in white suits carrying dead poultry out of barns – these are not new to anyone involved in poultry farming or bird conservation all across Europe.\n\nPoultry farmer Alrik Visscher from Dalfsen in the eastern part of the Netherlands is one of the farmers who has lost all his birds because of the flu. Visscher runs a family farm together with his parents, where four of his barns are now empty. Normally, up to 115,000 chickens would be walking around here, picking grain and laying eggs. Now, the Visschers are cleaning and disinfecting everything.\n\nIt was August 1 when Visscher discovered the first signs of the bird flu in some of his birds: They were quieter, blinking, some already dead. Just a day later, all the other chickens were culled as a protective measure.\n\n\"It's a mess what you feel: You feel sad, but you also feel: We have to do it like this,\" Visscher remembers. \"Because you have so many chickens, you don't think you have bond with them. But then you're gonna discover that.\" Not only emotionally, but also financially the farmers are hit badly. They lost all their sources of income. \n\nAlrik Visscher and his parents has lost all their chickens, depriving the family of all sources of income\n\nCurrent bird flu season does not end\n\nThere have been regular outbreaks of this sickness, which is deadly for many birds, for more than year, though normally, the bird flu season in Europe lasts from October until April or May. Poultry farmers, bird conservationists and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) all claim that this epidemic season is exceptional. In the Netherlands alone, more than 4 million chickens and ducks had to be culled, while hundreds of thousands wild birds have died.\n\nBarely any European country escaped cases of bird flu among wild birds or poultry since the beginning of this season in October 2021. What's new is that colony-breeding wild bird populations along the northwestern coasts of Europe are affected, according to the EFSA's latest report.\n\nBut also in the US, new outbreaks have been registered every other day. Just like in the Netherlands, where the density of poultry farms is among the highest in Europe. According to the EFSA, high poultry density is one of the factors leading to a faster spread of the virus, which usually comes from Asia via migratory wild birds spending the winter in Europe. When they leave in April, the virus normally leaves with them. Not this year, however: In the Netherlands, waterfowl are the most affected.\n\nOver 47 million birds had to be culled in European barns during this epidemic season\n\n'It can come from anywhere'\n\nGusts of wind carrying the feathers of infected birds, mice who touched bird droppings – It is small things like these that can bring the virus into the barns of poultry farmers. Although the countries have introduced tight hygiene measures, outbreaks have not stopped.\n\nBetween October and July, no chickens were allowed to go outside in the whole of the Netherlands, a quarantine that is still in place in huge parts of the country.\n\nA positive test at one farm leads to the installation of a 3-kilometer-wide-protection zone in which all farms have to prove they have no bird flu – and at affected farms all birds are culled as the virus is highly infectious. It kills fast, as Visscher had to find out. On the first day, he found 10 dead chickens, but the next day there were already hundreds of them.\n\n\"We have done everything we could so that the virus stays outside our farms,\" said Bart Jan Oplaat, chairman of the Dutch Union of poultry farmers. The rules in France, the second largest poultry producer in the EU, are very similar.\n\nThe outbreaks are also devastating among wild birds, explains Ruud van Beusekom, spokesperson of Vogelbescherming Nederland, an organization of Dutch bird conservationists.\n\nHe is especially worried about the population of sandwich terns, a species has been on the red list of endangered species in the Netherlands even before the bird flu outbreaks. As the population was beginning to recover, 25,000 sandwich terns died this year because of the flu.\n\nPlay Video\nBird flu threatens African Penguins\nQuarantine measures also for farmer families\n\nBut a solution is not in sight. Measures like quarantines and early cullings of animals on the farms can lower the threat of a spread – but they cannot contain it completely. The Visschers have also had to keep all their animals inside, after a duck farm nearby caught the virus.\n\nThe ducks themselves were inside before the outbreak. Some poultry farmers are even reducing their own activities outside of their farms to make sure they don't bring the virus to their animals, according to Oplaat of the Union of Poultry Farmers. Children playing at different houses or farms have to shower right away, when they get home, for example.\n\nAnother idea among Dutch farmers: Nets that collect feathers and other particles that could contain the virus from the air. Oplaat reported that two farms with these nets still had an outbreak of bird flu. And it will take some years until a proper vaccine is available. EFSA will soon start to collect data to assess vaccination strategies at least until July 2023 and trials to test bird flu vaccines have already started in France and the Netherlands.\n\nEven if this vaccine is available, bird flu will not vanish. Wild birds cannot be vaccinated and the virus is likely to mutate further. This is also the reason why it stayed this year. In rare cases, mammals also caught the bird flu, but the risk for humans is very low, according to the EFSA. The only hope among bird conservationists and farmers is now: A vast spread of the virus leading to a high immunity among the local birds.\n\nFarmer Visscher is now preparing to host new chickens. Until the end of October, his entire farm will have to be disinfected and cleaned. New hygiene measures are to be announced; only then can new birds arrive. But when the migratory birds from Siberia return for the winter, they may bring new variants, which could change the situation again.\n\nEdited by: Nicole Goebel",

    "text": "When Salman Rushdie's fourth novel, \"The Satanic Verses,\" appeared in its English-language first edition on September 26, 1988, the writer could not yet have imagined that this book would fundamentally change his life.\n\nNow, nearly 34 years later, numerous festivals and literary associations have invited people to solidarity readings — not to mark this year's anniversary, but because of the assassination attempt against Rushdie decades after Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa calling for the author's murder in February 1989. \n\n\"The Satanic Verses\" was first published in Britain, then in the United States, Italy and France. Muslims quickly protested against the novel and its author. South Africa, India and Pakistan stopped the import of the book; people ended up dying during demonstrations.\n\nIn London, where Rushdie was living at the time, there were also violent protests, arson attacks and threats against bookstores selling the novel.\n\nRushdie's story is about two Indian actors who survive a plane crash. One becomes an archangel; the other resembles the devil. The title of the novel refers to two verses that are said to have been whispered to the Prophet Muhammad by Satan and therefore erased from the Koran.\n\n\"The Satanic Verses\" in German\n\nIn fact, Rushdie's novel is not a critique of Islam, but a narrative about postcolonialism and migration. Rushdie later said that he never wanted to insult Islam. He could have done that in five minutes instead of working on a book for five years, he said.\n\nAlmost half a year after the novel's publication, Khomeini issued a fatwa, or Islamic legal opinion, calling on all Muslims to kill the British-Indian writer for alleged blasphemy. Rushdie immediately went into hiding, living in secrecy and under personal protection for nine years.\n\n'Fatwa led to paralysis' for German publisher\n\nKhomeini directed the death call not only against Rushdie, but against everyone involved in the publication of the novel.\n\nA quarter of a year earlier, Reinhold Neven DuMont, then head of publishing at Kiepenheuer & Witsch, had acquired the book rights for the German-language market. He later describes it as his biggest mistake not to have read the complete manuscript in advance — not because of the impending danger itself, but because he had thus not seen it coming.\n\n\"The fatwa led to paralysis in the publishing house,\" Helge Malchow, editor at the time and later publishing director, told DW. Some of the staff wanted to drop publication, if with a heavy heart, because of the life-threatening situation. \"Others wanted to defend artistic freedom and publish the book,\" he recalled.\n\nThe translator who had already been commissioned halted the project, and Kiepenheuer & Witsch refrained from the planned publication for the time being.\n\nPublic criticism of the dithering attitude was gathering steam, but Malchow cautioned that \"it was the first Islamist threat of this kind, and it caught us completely unawares.\"\n\nPublished in taz newspaper\n\nArno Widmann, co-founder of Germany's left-wing taz daily, told DW that he saw things differently.\n\n\"I thought it was a crime not to publish the book,\" he said. \n\nGerman writer Hans Magnus Enzensberger turned to Widmann's friend Frank Berberich, publisher of the culture magazine Lettre International. Enzensberger suggested Berberich print excerpts from Rushdie's book there.\n\nBut the idea was dropped because of the magazine's quarterly publication cycle. Berberich suggested printing excerpts in taz.\n\n\"I thought it was a crime not to publish the book,\" Arno Widmann said\n\nWidmann severely criticized the German publishing industry in several articles at the time. He said Germany was hiding while other countries were standing up for freedom of expression, and that these publishers were not intimidated by the protests. \n\nSo, when taz went ahead and printed the excerpts, as expected \"we received too little attention,\" Widmann said.\n\nAssassinations and brutal attacks \n\nDespite the clamorous criticism of the publishing decision, the concerns turned out to be well-founded. In July 1991, the Italian translator Ettore Capriolo survived a knife attack in Milan with serious injuries. A few days later, Hitoshi Igarashi, a Japanese translator and Islamic scholar, was stabbed to death by one or more unknown persons in front of his office at the University of Tsukuba.\n\nJamshid Khasani, who had translated \"The Satanic Verses\" into Farsi, fled Tehran in 1992 via several countries to Israel, where he settled under a new name.\n\nAfter the Turkish writer Aziz Nesin announced that he would publish excerpts from Rushdie's book, Islamists carried out an arson attack on a culture festival in 1993 because Nesin was scheduled to be there. Nesin managed to escape, but 37 people died. That same year in Oslo the book's Norwegian publisher, William Nygaard, was shot three times, an attack he survived.\n\nDecades later, on August 12, 2022, Rushdie himself survived an assassination attempt, though was seriously injured. He was on artificial respiration for a time and will suffer permanent damage.\n\nAfter years in hiding and under police protection, Rushdie has described living in New York freely and without concern for his life.\n\nPlay Video\n42:36 min\nSalman Rushdie - A marked man\nPublishing house for just one book\n\nBack in 1989, about 100 publishing houses, writers' associations, editors and authors got together to found a new publishing house that would publish \"The Satanic Verses\" in German. The idea was that no publishing house should be the sole target of possible retaliatory attacks. Kiepenheuer & Witsch was responsible for printing and distribution.\n\nThe Article 19 publishing house, whose name refers to the freedom of expression in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, served the sole purpose of publishing Rushdie's novel. The collective donated the profits of the sales to the PEN writers' association for the benefit of persecuted authors.\n\nRushdie was not happy about the collective solution; he would have preferred his publisher to take an unequivocal stance. \"He was downright outraged,\" Helge Malchow remembered, adding the writer felt the decision was like backing off from the threat.\n\nOn October 17, 1989, \"The Satanic Verses\" hit the German-language market. To this day, the person who translated the novel has not been publicly identified.\n\nBernhard Robben, translator\n\n'Concentrated hatred'\n\nBernhard Robben, who later translated several of Rushdie's works into German, told DW that, as much as he would have liked to translate the book, he struggled with the idea of living \"in fear of death.\" \n\nThe translator had met Rushdie earlier through a mutual friend, the British writer Ian McEwan. Robben was living in Oxford at the time and he and Rushdie met and got along well. But then Rushdie had to go into hiding.\n\nAfter the fatwa was announced, Robben finally agreed to translate \"The Satanic Verses.\" He recalls friends were aghast. He told them \"I can't not do it.\" \n\nIt was unthinkable to him that this book would not be published in German and that the attack on freedom of expression would succeed.\n\nIn the end, the publishing collective decided to have several translators work simultaneously so that publication would not be delayed.\n\nIn his 2012 memoir, \"Joseph Anton\" — his alias under police protection — Rushdie speculates that \"The Satanic Verses\" would not find a publisher today because the risk of attacks is greater today than back then. \n\nBernhard Robben, who co-translated \"Joseph Anton,\" is in fact \"pretty sure it wouldn't be published today.\"\n\nPEN: NO FREEDOM FOR THE WORD\nSalman Rushdie\n\nThe British-Indian author quickly earned the ire of Iran's Ayatollah after publishing his book \"Satanic Verses\" in 1988. The book makes several references to figures in Christianity and Islam, leading Ayatollah Khomeini to issue a fatwa against the writer and calling on Muslims all over the world to kill him.

    "brief": "The gas from the Nord Stream pipeline leaks would have been burned for energy use regardless of the leak, so it is unlikely that more emissions were released than normal. Research has found that methane emissions are 80 times worse than carbon dioxide emissions over a 20 year scale — and that they already account for roughly 30% of global warming. Human activity over the past 150 years has prompted a huge rise in artificial greenhouse gas emissions, causing global temperatures to soar at an alarming rate. Data show that the impact of a man-made climate crisis from greenhouse gas emissions is already being felt around the world — including in Germany. At the UN global climate conference COP26 late last year, more than 100 nations pledged to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030.

    "text": "Major leaks on the Nord Stream 1 and 2 pipelines releasing huge amounts of gas into the surrounding Baltic Sea and atmosphere were reported on Monday.\n\nImages show the surface of the sea broiling as gas erupted from pipelines 80-110 meters (265-360 feet) below sea level. The long-term impact of the explosion is hard to quantify.\n\nʺAccording to our current knowledge, the leaks in the Nord Stream pipeline do not pose any serious threat to the marine environment of the Baltic Sea,ʺ a spokesperson for Germany's Environment Ministry told DW.\n\nExperts say the long-term climate impact of the emissions will be substantial.\n\nʺThe most direct effect of these gas leaks on climate is the extra dollop of the powerful greenhouse gas methane they are adding to the atmosphere,ʺ Dave Reay, executive director of the University of Edinburgh’s Climate Change Institute, said in a statement.\n\nʺThat said, this is a wee bubble in the ocean compared to the huge amounts of so-called 'fugitive methane' that are emitted every day around the world due to things like fracking, coal mining and oil extraction,ʺ he said.\n\nThe scale of the Nord Stream gas leaks is not yet known. Neither pipeline was in operation, but both contained natural gas.\n\nPlay Video\n0:00 min\nWhat's behind the Nord Stream pipeline leaks?\nNatural gas leaks are an environmental hazard\n\nThe gas from the Nord Stream pipeline leaks would have been burned for energy use regardless of the leak, so it is unlikely that more emissions were released than normal.\n\nMethane is the main component of natural gas and significantly more harmful than carbon dioxide, the biggest contributor to climate change. \n\nThe only reason methane is not the biggest contributor to the warming of our planet is because there is far less of it in our atmosphere than CO2 — only about 0.00017%, or 1.7 parts per million. There’s around 200 times more CO2 floating around.\n\nResearch has found that methane emissions are 80 times worse than carbon dioxide emissions over a 20 year scale — and that they already account for roughly 30% of global warming.\n\nMethane contributes to climate crisis via greenhouse effect\n\nGreenhouse gases such as methane act as a blanket insulating the Earth. They absorb energy and slow the rate at which heat leaves the planet through a process called the greenhouse effect.\n\nFor centuries, the greenhouse effect has occurred organically because of the natural release of methane and carbon dioxide from plants, animals and wetland areas.\n\nHuman activity over the past 150 years has prompted a huge rise in artificial greenhouse gas emissions, causing global temperatures to soar at an alarming rate. \n\nData show that the impact of a man-made climate crisis from greenhouse gas emissions is already being felt around the world — including in Germany.\n\nTemperatures have been rising year on year since records began in the late 19th century\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions increasing in Europe\n\nGlobal leaders have acknowledged that reducing methane emissions is vital to limiting global warming and averting the worst impacts of climate change.\n\nAt the UN global climate conference COP26 late last year, more than 100 nations pledged to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030.\n\n\nPlay Video\n0:00 min\nCOP26: World leaders agree to slash methane emissions\n\nGovernments in Europe have been criticized for U-turns on the pledges. Energy-related greenhouse gas emissions are currently 6% higher than they were when the conference took place less than a year ago. \n\nSince the start of the war in Ukraine, countries such as Germany have been scrambling to replace cheap natural gas imports from Russia with short-term solutions like the reopening of coal plants.\n\nWill closing Nord Stream change energy strategies?\n\nNord Stream 1 and 2 are now shut down indefinitely because of the leaks — but many countries in Europe, including Germany, rely on these gas pipelines for energy.\n\nRoughly 10% of Germany's energy comes from gas, and, although the country has stored enough to keep it going for some months, those stores will run out.\n\nIt is currently unclear how closing the Nord Stream pipelines will affect the European Union's energy strategies in the coming months.\n\nEdited by: Clare Roth",

    "text": "There's a reason why carbon dioxide has become the bogeyman of the climate crisis, considering just how much of it we've pumped into the atmosphere. We haven't stopped at CO2, however. Oh no, we've added methane into the toxic mix. While the gas, also known as CH4, has become almost synonymous with cattle flatulence, there's actually much more to it than that. And it's nothing like as funny as a fart. Or a burp, which are the bigger bodily offenders. \n\nScientists estimate that although methane only accounts for 3% of emissions since 1750, it is linked to as much as 23% of historic warming. In other words, the stuff is potent. Really potent. As in, a single ton of methane causes roughly the equivalent warming of at least 28 tons of CO2 over the course of a century. And in the last two decades alone, we've managed to increase our output by 10%. \n\nReducing the amount that seeps into the atmosphere could be a secret weapon in the climate fight. In fact it could, according to a UN Environmental Programme (UNEP) report , avoid 0.3 degrees Celsius of warming by the 2040s.\n\nCapping global heating to 1.5 degrees C by 2050 is a key aim of the IPCC 2015 Paris Climate Accord\n\nLet's just do that then ...\n\nIf only it were that simple. Methane is not only the natural gas that supplies power stations and heats homes, it's also the stuff that wafts from landfills, rice paddies, the intestines of ruminants, wetlands, and in some instances, supposedly \"green\" hydropower reservoirs. \n\nAll told, the world emits 570 million tons of CH4 a year. We humans are responsible for 60% of that, with the gold medal going to farming. Partly, but not only, as a result of gassy livestock, the agricultural sector causes the same amount of warming as 788 million cars, which is more than half of the world's 1.4 billion-strong fleet. \n\nSilver goes to none other than the fossil fuel industry, with the waste sector snatching bronze.\n\nFossil fuel infrastructure is a major, and avoidable, source of methane. Damaged and poorly maintained gas pipes leak the gas through patchable holes and processes, leading to what are commonly called \"fugitive emissions.\" If they were better maintained, the equivalent of 1.83 billion tons of CO2 could be saved. And what's more, the natural gas saved from patching up the leaks would more than pay for the upgrades.\n\nFossil fuel operations are a major source of methane emissions\n\nSounds like a CH4 win-win\n\nHmmm. Yes, infrastructure improvements could reduce leaks, and tracing them is becoming easier thanks to satellite imaging that detects them, thereby making it harder for fossil fuel companies to hide or deny the flaws in their systems.   \n\nAnd by the same token, recovering burnable methane from waste could be financially incentivized. Landfill gas projects across the world are already capturing methane to burn. In the US, 70% of these LFGs produce gas for electricity generation. And at least we can use methane to burn.\n\nBut that's not ideal, since it produces carbon dioxide, which, as we've already established, is the bogeyman of the climate crisis.\n\nMethane recovery system in place at a landfill in Marshall, Michigan, US\n\nWhy is it always so complicated?\n\nThat's a good one, but hang on, there's more. Because although we can change dodgy pipes, we can't exactly replumb our farmyard friends, which makes shrinking our animal's methane footprint a tad trickier.\n\nThat said, we can go some way to mitigating the problem by changing what we feed them. Something called FutureFeed, for example, does exactly that: it's a livestock feed that contains 3% Australian seaweed which has been shown to reduce emissions by 80%. Just a little bit of dietary greens cuts back on cow burps. Not bad going. \n\nAn easier option would be to change what we eat. Less meat and dairy equals fewer animals, equals fewer gases being belched out into the atmosphere.\n\nCutting down on meat can't be the answer to everything...\n\nNot everything, but it ticks a couple of boxes. But we don't need to go there now. Not when we could be talking permafrost. \n\nMost of the methane from livestock comes from the burps of ruminants like cows and lamb\n\nPermawhat?\n\nPermafrost. Thing is, as the Arctic heats up, areas of Earth that have been locked in frozen slumber for many millennia, are starting to thaw. And as that happens, they're not only revealing pristine condition — albeit dead — big cat species lost long ago to extinction, but thousands of years' worth of methane and CO2. \n\nSome of this former icescape then transforms into new wetlands, which release methane into the atmosphere, helping temperatures to rise. Thawing permafrost could increase non-human methane emissions by 80%. And that, in turn increases the likelihood of droughts, fires, flooding and other extreme weather events everywhere around the world.\n\n\nThawing permafrosts in Siberia and nothern Canada could transform into methane intensive wetlands with a heating Arctic\n\nGreat. So where does that leave us?\n\nWith a gap between what's needed and what is actually being done. The latest IPCC report laid bare just how quickly we need to cut global greenhouse gas emissions before things get even worse. \n\nWhile it might be impossible to do away with man-made methane emissions completely, cutting them even a little could generate time enough to develop green technologies, such as low-carbon planes and ships.\n\nWhat's more, methane emitted at ground level forms ozone which can damage respiratory health. According to the UNEP, reducing CH4 output by45% could prevent 255,000 premature deaths per year.\n\nLike many climate and environmental issues, policymakers are the ones with the power to affect meaningful, lasting change. But even as individuals we can make a contribution by (whether we like it or not), cutting back on burgers, palm oil and flying. Giving these industries our money sends them a seal of approval to continue with business as usual. But that, we have seen by now, is the one thing the planet cannot afford to let happen. \n\nEdited by: Tamsin Walker\n\nThis article was originally published on September 15, 2021.

    "text": "If presidential candidate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva of Brazil's left-wing PT Worker's Party is to believed, Brazil's upcoming election this Sunday will be a vote on the country's very independence. Losing the election, in his view, would bring an end to Brazilian democracy. This is a curious understanding of free elections. One that is not too dissimilar to that of right-wing populist President Jair Bolsonaro, who claims Brazil faces a rigged election — an accusation for which he has presented no evidence.\n\nSeveral days ago, Brazilian news outlet Estadao wrote that Lula was insulting anyone who will not vote for him, treating them like \"enemies.\" Lula, who governed the country between 2003 and 2011, has deliberately chosen this aggressive campaign rhetoric, opting for an approach similar to divisive President Bolsonaro. As such, classifying them as left-wing and right-wing populist figures, respectively, make sense — even though the Lula camp disagrees. Neither side wishes to be labeled populist.\n\nShrill rhetoric\n\nIf polls are accurate, Lula will win the vote, taking charge of a deeply polarized country from January 1, 2023. This polarization, mind you, is attributable not only to Bolsonaro's controversial comments, but also to Lula's sharp rhetoric. He has, for instance, compared participants of pro-Bolsonaro rallies to Ku Klux Klan sympathizers. While Bolsonaro and is wife Michelle claim they must protect Brazil from demons, the devil and Communism, and accuse Lula of being a thief, Lula says the country faces the danger of fascism, the Ku Klux Klan, and illiberalism. He even accuses Bolsonaro of committing genocide.\n\nDW's Tobias Käufer\n\nHow are both camps supposed to re-unite after the election, when they a variously framed as fascists, Communists, devils, demons, thieves, agents of genocide, or Ku Klux Klan sympathizers?\n\nDisastrous track records\n\nBoth figures' dismal track records explain why this election campaign has been accompanied by such shrill populist rhetoric. After four years under the inept leadership of Bolsonaro, Brazilian society finds itself in crisis. At this time, it would be necessary for the rival camp to pursue a reconciliatory course to build bridges.\n\nBut instead, Lula's verbal attacks are designed to distract Brazilians from his own failings, and those of his party. After all, after 13 years under PT rule, Brazil found itself in such a bad state that voters turned to Bolsonaro in 2018 — after a brief stint by President Michel Temer, that is. Bolsonaro's victory was not the result of fake news, as is so commonly claimed by populists. The truth of the matters is that never in Brazil's history has there been greater destruction of rainforest than under Lula. Until this day, his involvement in the huge Odebrechtand Petrobras corruption scandals has not been properly investigated. And his decision to have Brazil host the football world cup and Olympic games, while the country's hospitals and schools fell into disrepair, caused severe economic problems and social tensions. While Lula is right to attack Bolsonaro for trivializing Brazil's former military dictatorship, one should likewise criticize Lula for supporting the brutally oppressive left-wing regimes of Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua, from which people flee constantly, some of them dying as they make their escape.\n\nModerates are drowned out\n\nLambasting political rivals sparks fiery exchanges on social networks, distracting from real issues. This prevents much-needed debates over the root causes of Brazil's problems, to which both front-running candidates have contributed.\n\nThe biggest tragedy of this vitriolic campaign, however, is that more moderate candidates running for Brazil's top job are being drowned out. And that means populism wins, yet again.\n\nThis opinion piece was originally written in German.\n\nA previous version of this article mistakenly said the incoming president would take over the post from December 1, 2023 — the elected president will, however, take office on January 1, 2023. Additionally, the piece stated President Bolsonaro came to power following a 2019 election — the vote where he was elected president took place in 2018 and he assumed office on January 1, 2019. This has now been corrected. The department apologizes for the error.",

Not even holy water could \"wash away this disgrace,\" Karimi wrote.\n\nProtesters have reportedly been chanting Karimi's and Mahini's names in demonstrations around the country. Last week, Karimi's house in Tehran was seized for several days.\n\nFans of Karimi's former club, Bayern Munich, offered support to the protests in Iran when during Friday's Bundesliga match against Bayer Leverkusen, fans unfurled a banner that read: \"Women, Life, Freedom! Solidarity with the feminist revolution in Iran!\"\n\nWerder Bremen fans also put up a banner during their club's match on Saturday against Borussia Mönchengladbach reading: \"Down with the patriarchy, down with the Mullah regime. Long live the feminist revolution in Iran.\"\n\nBeyond football \n\nIranian athletes from other sports are also standing up to those in power.\nSadjad Estaki, who in 2015 became the first Iranian to play in Germany's renowned national handball league, announced his resignation from the Iranian national team in protest of the heavy-handed response to Iranian demonstrations.\n\nMojtaba Abedini, the country's most successful fencer and captain of the national team, has also quit. \"Out of solidarity with the oppressed citizens of my homeland,\" Abedini posted. \"I see it as my duty to declare my resignation from the national team in light of these events and out of respect for them.\"\n\nThe barricades are still burning in Tehran weeks after the death of Mahsa Amini\n\nActive players have also offered their support to the protests.\n\n\"Shame on you all, how carelessly people are murdered! Long live Iranian women!\" posted Sardar Azmoun, the Bayer Leverkusen attacker. His post was later deleted, however, and an apology posted in its place.\n\nBut other Iranian teammates condemned the violence against the demonstrators.\n\n\"We are always on the side of the people who demand nothing but their basic rights these days,\" wrote Iran national team captain Alireza Jahanbakhsh.\n\nThe response to these statements, however, has been divided. Many fans on social networks were angry that the criticism was too hesitant and timid. For the national team, which is the center of the sporting world for the football-loving people of Iran, support is crumbling shortly before the World Cup in Qatar.\n\nNo World Cup for Iran?\n\nThe Iranian women's rights group known as Open Stadiums has called on FIFA to expel Iran from the upcoming men's World Cup.\n\n\"Why should FIFA give the Iranian state and its representatives a global stage?\" reads a letter that the organization sent to FIFA President Gianni Infantino. \"This state not only refuses to respect fundamental rights and human dignity. It tortures and kills its own people.\"\n\nThe purely sporting perspective seems to have faded completely into the background in Iran. Solidarity and the fight for more women's rights has united many.\n\nRecord-appearance holder Ali Daei spoke out against oppression and violence via Instagram, while former international Mehdi Mahdavikia was not afraid to warn those in power after the arrest of Hossein Mahini: \"These days will go down in the memory of history,\" the 45-year-old former Hamburg and Eintracht Frankfurt player wrote.\n\nIn addition, he posted in symbolic fashion eight hands and arms holding each other. They stand for the country's various ethnic groups, which, according to the repeated concern from Tehran, could fall apart if there is no longer a strong central leadership. Their power is being shaken by the protests.\n\nThis article was adapted from German.\n\nIRAN: WORLDWIDE SOLIDARITY WITH ONGOING PROTESTS\nParis\n\nMany people around the world have been showing solidarity with the protesters in Iran. In the heart of the French capital, Paris, demonstrators marched on Sunday from the Place de la Republique to the Place de la Nation, chanting \"Death to the Islamic Republic\" and \"Death to the dictator.\"\n\n\n\n123456",

    "text": "Self-determined. Body-positive. Woke.\n\nThese adjectives weren't common in 1950s Hollywood during the peak of actor Marilyn Monroe's career.\n\nMore often labeled \"blonde bombshell\" or \"sex symbol,\" she actually bucked some of the social trends of the mid-20th century that still strike a chord today  — and that is 60 years after she succumbed to a barbiturate overdose on August 5, 1962. \n\nOn September 28, \"Blonde,\"  Netflix's Monroe biopic, is released on the streaming platform in Europe, Australia and beyond.\n\nHaving premiered at the 2022 Venice Film Festival and been released in cinemas in the US on September 16 and in the UK on September 23, many critics have already celebrated the film, and especially the performance of the lead, Cuban-born Ana de Armas.\n\nOther reviewers, including the Chicago Sun-Times, called it \"overlong\" and \"overwrought\" and lamented that the film \"depicts Marilyn Monroe’s life as a joyless nightmare.\"\n\nBut Ana de Armas, the latest actor to embody the troubled Hollywood icon, was roundly lauded. US entertainment news outlet Variety wrote that she \"gives us nothing less than what we came for. She becomes Marilyn Monroe.\" Meanwhile, the Guardian newspaper called the Cuban actress \"simply extraordinary\" in the role.\n\nActress Ana de Armas was lauded for her portrayal of Monroe\n\nFiction, not a biopic\n\n\"Blonde\" recreated iconic Marilyn Monroe movie scenes —  including the moment when the star stood over a subway ventilation shaft that whipped up her white dress. The star's wardrobe was also faithfully recreated for the film. \n\nBut the film is mostly fictional, borrowing its title —  and inspired by —  the 2000 novel by US author Joyce Carol Oates. This Monroe story is an attempt to delve into the gap between the private Norma Jeane Mortenson (Monroe's birth name), and the Marilyn figure she created. \n\nWriter and director Andrew Dominik (\"Killing Them Softly\") has said that he wanted \"Blonde\" to play out the tension between Monroe's interior life and the \"collective memory\" of her. \n\nBeyond the two dimensional character\n\nWith her mother struggling with mental health issues and her father's identity unknown, Norma Jeane Mortenson grew up in foster homes where she was sexually abused.\n\nMonroe's troubled private life has been thoroughly dissected over the decades: Failed marriages, miscarriages and abortions, drug abuse, rumored liaisons with film studio bigwigs, as well as the Kennedy brothers. \n\nProfessionally, her come-hither looks, breathy voice — a strategy suggested by a speech therapist to overcome a stutter — and the sexuality-driven roles she landed, reduced her to a two dimensional character that pandered primarily to male fantasies.\n\nOne of the film's most shocking scenes implies that Monroe was raped by John F. Kennedy, with whom she was said to have been having a consensual affair.\n\nWhile there is no official record of this abuse, the scene works to highlight Monroe's victimization and debasement as a sex object. \n\nThe film depicts the actress's fraught relationships with the men in her life\n\nUS news site The Daily Beast called the sequence \"the most horrifying scene of the film,\" having dubbed the biopic \"a horror show filled with disturbing imagery.\"\n\nSuch scenes are likely what led to the NC-17 rating, something actress de Armas told French fashion magazine L’Officiel, she disagreed with. \n\n“I can tell you a number of shows or movies that are way more explicit with a lot more sexual content than 'Blonde',\" she said. \"But to tell this story it is important to show all these moments in Marilyn’s life that made her end up the way that she did. It needed to be explained. Everyone [in the cast] knew we had to go to uncomfortable places. I wasn’t the only one.\"\n\nAn unlikely feminist icon\n\nIn the decades since Monroe's death, she has been embraced as a feminist icon. Originally held up as an example of why feminism was necessary to counter the sexual exploitation and objectification of women, she has since been recognized for her own demands for self-determination. \nWay before Facebook boss Sheryl Sandberg rallied women to \"lean in\" and claim their rightful place at the executive table, Monroe had already warmed the seat.\n\nSigned to Twentieth Century Fox, she had grown weary of \"dumb blonde\" roles and wanted more say in the scripts and roles she took on.  She set up Marilyn Monroe Productions in 1955, becoming the second woman in the US, after Mary Pickford, to start her own production company.\n\nMonroe was tired of being typecast and set up her own production company\n\nFollowing much legal wrangling, Monroe and the movie company struck a deal that saw her successfully negotiating for back pay, a higher salary and a role in selecting scripts, directors and cinematographers — a rare victory for a female actor back then.\n\nShe called out #MeToo encounters\n\nIn \"Wolves I Have Known,\" an article Monroe authored for the January 1953 issue of Motion Picture and Television Magazine, she denounced the sexual harassment rampant in Hollywood at the time.\n\nDescribing the men in the industry, the then-27-year-old wrote: \"There are many types of wolves. Some are sinister, others are just good-time Charlies trying to get something for nothing and others make a game of it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, she was unabashed about her curves and embraced her sexuality in a way once seen as the antithesis of feminism. Today she is seen as a pioneer of body positivity. \n\nMarilyn was woke\n\nHer keen mind and informed views on politics and social justice were often also ignored. One of her most-mentioned acts of awareness was when she used her celebrity to enable jazz star Ella Fitzgerald to perform at a club that originally refused to hire her.\n\nThe Mocambo club's management apparently thought Fitzgerald lacked the glamor to perform at the Hollywood hot spot. Monroe urged club owner Charlie Morrison to book Fitzgerald, and in return promised to personally attend every show and sit in the front row.\n\nFitzgerald (left) described her supporter and friend Monroe as being \"ahead of her time\"\n\nMonroe was an \"eternal shape-shifter\" whose \"multiple transformations allow each generation, even each individual, to create a Marilyn to their own specifications,\" wrote one of Monroe's biographers, Lois Banner, a history and gender studies professor at the University of Southern California. \n\nDespite its fictional origins, \"Blonde\" dwells on the complex persona of a superstar who still resonates with the public 60 years after her death.\n\nThis is an updated version of an article that was originally published on August 4, 2022. ",

She met the current leader of the Christian Democrats, Friedrich Merz — a man she deeply dislikes — at the Helmut Kohl Foundation. Also that week, Merkel held a speech in the northern German city of Goslar in honor of the town's 1,100-year-anniversay. These events were predictably unspectacular. And, unsurprisingly, Merkel said nothing truly ground-breaking.\n\nThis is, however, surprising, given that many once regarded Merkel as the savior of the free West, especially when US President Donald Trump controlled the White House.\n\nMerkel recently announced she will publish her memoirs in autumn 2024.\n\nApart from this, the woman who governed Germany for 16 years has largely kept out of the public eye.\n\nHardly anyone is asking Merkel for advice\n\nThis is clearly her choice. Merkel is sticking to her pledge, keeping to herself, as she has no need for the limelight. Yet so much has happened in the 12 months since the last general election that it feels as if Merkel's tenure ended light years ago.\n\nDW's Jens Thurau\n\nHardly anyone is asking her advice on the worrying state of world affairs, presumably also because one cannot help feel she left her successor Olaf Scholz, of the Social Democrats, and his coalition government to sort out a big mess when she left. \n\nFor a decade and a half, Merkel did nothing to reduce Germany's dependence on Russian energy. Merkel failed to lead Germany into the digital age. During her tenure, underfunding wreaked havoc on German infrastructure and public institutions. And in 2015, she kindly opened German borders to refugees, mainly of them Syrian, yet failed to work out how to better manage long-term immigration.\n\nNo inconveniences, please\n\nThe way the German government and Merkel's own party, the Christian Democrats, see her now has changed over the past year. Few still laud her trademark calmness, modesty and pragmatism. While she is not accused of making wrong political decisions per se, many do take issue with all the matters she failed to address.\n\nSure, blaming Merkel for having misjudged und underestimated Russian President Vladimir Putin is a cheap shot to make. After all, almost all Western politicians made this mistake. But one can rightly criticize her attitude of having wanted to spare Germans any inconvenience. These care-free times, after all, are over.\n\nMerkel's politics lacked courage\n\nSpeaking at the opening of the Helmut Kohl Foundation in Berlin this week, she said one must take Putinseriously, and think about what will follow when the war ends. These comments sound like they stem from an old, forgotten era. Nobody is underestimating the belligerent Russian president anymore, that is certain. And what point is there in thinking about the post-war era, what should anyone discuss with Putin, who has just launched a 'partial military mobilization' in Russia?\n\nMaybe, one day, historians will look kindly on Merkel's legacy, especially if Germany succeeds in weathering this severe crisis — the biggest since World War II. Germany has radically changed in the months since Merkel left office. German society and German businesses are deeply concerned about the future. While Merkel is not to blame for this anxiety, a more courageous approach could have paid off.\n\nThis article was originally written in German.",

Woke.\n\nThese adjectives weren't common in 1950s Hollywood during the peak of actor Marilyn Monroe's career.\n\nMore often labeled \"blonde bombshell\" or \"sex symbol,\" she actually bucked some of the social trends of the mid-20th century that still strike a chord today  — and that is 60 years after she succumbed to a barbiturate overdose on August 5, 1962. \n\nOn September 28, \"Blonde,\"  Netflix's Monroe biopic, is released on the streaming platform in Europe, Australia and beyond.\n\nHaving premiered at the 2022 Venice Film Festival and been released in cinemas in the US on September 16 and in the UK on September 23, many critics have already celebrated the film, and especially the performance of the lead, Cuban-born Ana de Armas.\n\nOther reviewers, including the Chicago Sun-Times, called it \"overlong\" and \"overwrought\" and lamented that the film \"depicts Marilyn Monroe’s life as a joyless nightmare.\"\n\nBut Ana de Armas, the latest actor to embody the troubled Hollywood icon, was roundly lauded. US entertainment news outlet Variety wrote that she \"gives us nothing less than what we came for. She becomes Marilyn Monroe.\" Meanwhile, the Guardian newspaper called the Cuban actress \"simply extraordinary\" in the role.\n\nActress Ana de Armas was lauded for her portrayal of Monroe\n\nFiction, not a biopic\n\n\"Blonde\" recreated iconic Marilyn Monroe movie scenes —  including the moment when the star stood over a subway ventilation shaft that whipped up her white dress. The star's wardrobe was also faithfully recreated for the film. \n\nBut the film is mostly fictional, borrowing its title —  and inspired by —  the 2000 novel by US author Joyce Carol Oates. This Monroe story is an attempt to delve into the gap between the private Norma Jeane Mortenson (Monroe's birth name), and the Marilyn figure she created. \n\nWriter and director Andrew Dominik (\"Killing Them Softly\") has said that he wanted \"Blonde\" to play out the tension between Monroe's interior life and the \"collective memory\" of her. \n\nBeyond the two dimensional character\n\nWith her mother struggling with mental health issues and her father's identity unknown, Norma Jeane Mortenson grew up in foster homes where she was sexually abused.\n\nMonroe's troubled private life has been thoroughly dissected over the decades: Failed marriages, miscarriages and abortions, drug abuse, rumored liaisons with film studio bigwigs, as well as the Kennedy brothers. \n\nProfessionally, her come-hither looks, breathy voice — a strategy suggested by a speech therapist to overcome a stutter — and the sexuality-driven roles she landed, reduced her to a two dimensional character that pandered primarily to male fantasies.\n\nOne of the film's most shocking scenes implies that Monroe was raped by John F. Kennedy, with whom she was said to have been having a consensual affair.\n\nWhile there is no official record of this abuse, the scene works to highlight Monroe's victimization and debasement as a sex object. \n\nThe film depicts the actress's fraught relationships with the men in her life\n\nUS news site The Daily Beast called the sequence \"the most horrifying scene of the film,\" having dubbed the biopic \"a horror show filled with disturbing imagery.\"\n\nSuch scenes are likely what led to the NC-17 rating, something actress de Armas told French fashion magazine L’Officiel, she disagreed with. \n\n“I can tell you a number of shows or movies that are way more explicit with a lot more sexual content than 'Blonde',\" she said. \"But to tell this story it is important to show all these moments in Marilyn’s life that made her end up the way that she did. It needed to be explained. Everyone [in the cast] knew we had to go to uncomfortable places. I wasn’t the only one.\"\n\nAn unlikely feminist icon\n\nIn the decades since Monroe's death, she has been embraced as a feminist icon. Originally held up as an example of why feminism was necessary to counter the sexual exploitation and objectification of women, she has since been recognized for her own demands for self-determination. \nWay before Facebook boss Sheryl Sandberg rallied women to \"lean in\" and claim their rightful place at the executive table, Monroe had already warmed the seat.\n\nSigned to Twentieth Century Fox, she had grown weary of \"dumb blonde\" roles and wanted more say in the scripts and roles she took on.  She set up Marilyn Monroe Productions in 1955, becoming the second woman in the US, after Mary Pickford, to start her own production company.\n\nMonroe was tired of being typecast and set up her own production company\n\nFollowing much legal wrangling, Monroe and the movie company struck a deal that saw her successfully negotiating for back pay, a higher salary and a role in selecting scripts, directors and cinematographers — a rare victory for a female actor back then.\n\nShe called out #MeToo encounters\n\nIn \"Wolves I Have Known,\" an article Monroe authored for the January 1953 issue of Motion Picture and Television Magazine, she denounced the sexual harassment rampant in Hollywood at the time.\n\nDescribing the men in the industry, the then-27-year-old wrote: \"There are many types of wolves. Some are sinister, others are just good-time Charlies trying to get something for nothing and others make a game of it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, she was unabashed about her curves and embraced her sexuality in a way once seen as the antithesis of feminism. Today she is seen as a pioneer of body positivity. \n\nMarilyn was woke\n\nHer keen mind and informed views on politics and social justice were often also ignored. One of her most-mentioned acts of awareness was when she used her celebrity to enable jazz star Ella Fitzgerald to perform at a club that originally refused to hire her.\n\nThe Mocambo club's management apparently thought Fitzgerald lacked the glamor to perform at the Hollywood hot spot. Monroe urged club owner Charlie Morrison to book Fitzgerald, and in return promised to personally attend every show and sit in the front row.\n\nFitzgerald (left) described her supporter and friend Monroe as being \"ahead of her time\"\n\nMonroe was an \"eternal shape-shifter\" whose \"multiple transformations allow each generation, even each individual, to create a Marilyn to their own specifications,\" wrote one of Monroe's biographers, Lois Banner, a history and gender studies professor at the University of Southern California. \n\nDespite its fictional origins, \"Blonde\" dwells on the complex persona of a superstar who still resonates with the public 60 years after her death.\n\nThis is an updated version of an article that was originally published on August 4, 2022. ",

There have been regular outbreaks of this sickness, which is deadly for many birds, for more than year, though normally, the bird flu season in Europe lasts from October until April or May. In the Netherlands alone, more than 4 million chickens and ducks had to be culled, while hundreds of thousands wild birds have died. Barely any European country escaped cases of bird flu among wild birds or poultry since the beginning of this season in October 2021.

According to the EFSA, high poultry density is one of the factors leading to a faster spread of the virus, which usually comes from Asia via migratory wild birds spending the winter in Europe. A positive test at one farm leads to the installation of a 3-kilometer-wide-protection zone in which all farms have to prove they have no bird flu – and at affected farms all birds are culled as the virus is highly infectious. In rare cases, mammals also caught the bird flu, but the risk for humans is very low, according to the EFSA.

    "text": "Pictures of dead wild birds' carcasses, people in white suits carrying dead poultry out of barns – these are not new to anyone involved in poultry farming or bird conservation all across Europe.\n\nPoultry farmer Alrik Visscher from Dalfsen in the eastern part of the Netherlands is one of the farmers who has lost all his birds because of the flu. Visscher runs a family farm together with his parents, where four of his barns are now empty. Normally, up to 115,000 chickens would be walking around here, picking grain and laying eggs. Now, the Visschers are cleaning and disinfecting everything.\n\nIt was August 1 when Visscher discovered the first signs of the bird flu in some of his birds: They were quieter, blinking, some already dead. Just a day later, all the other chickens were culled as a protective measure.\n\n\"It's a mess what you feel: You feel sad, but you also feel: We have to do it like this,\" Visscher remembers. \"Because you have so many chickens, you don't think you have bond with them. But then you're gonna discover that.\" Not only emotionally, but also financially the farmers are hit badly. They lost all their sources of income. \n\nAlrik Visscher and his parents has lost all their chickens, depriving the family of all sources of income\n\nCurrent bird flu season does not end\n\nThere have been regular outbreaks of this sickness, which is deadly for many birds, for more than year, though normally, the bird flu season in Europe lasts from October until April or May. Poultry farmers, bird conservationists and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) all claim that this epidemic season is exceptional. In the Netherlands alone, more than 4 million chickens and ducks had to be culled, while hundreds of thousands wild birds have died.\n\nBarely any European country escaped cases of bird flu among wild birds or poultry since the beginning of this season in October 2021. What's new is that colony-breeding wild bird populations along the northwestern coasts of Europe are affected, according to the EFSA's latest report.\n\nBut also in the US, new outbreaks have been registered every other day. Just like in the Netherlands, where the density of poultry farms is among the highest in Europe. According to the EFSA, high poultry density is one of the factors leading to a faster spread of the virus, which usually comes from Asia via migratory wild birds spending the winter in Europe. When they leave in April, the virus normally leaves with them. Not this year, however: In the Netherlands, waterfowl are the most affected.\n\nOver 47 million birds had to be culled in European barns during this epidemic season\n\n'It can come from anywhere'\n\nGusts of wind carrying the feathers of infected birds, mice who touched bird droppings – It is small things like these that can bring the virus into the barns of poultry farmers. Although the countries have introduced tight hygiene measures, outbreaks have not stopped.\n\nBetween October and July, no chickens were allowed to go outside in the whole of the Netherlands, a quarantine that is still in place in huge parts of the country.\n\nA positive test at one farm leads to the installation of a 3-kilometer-wide-protection zone in which all farms have to prove they have no bird flu – and at affected farms all birds are culled as the virus is highly infectious. It kills fast, as Visscher had to find out. On the first day, he found 10 dead chickens, but the next day there were already hundreds of them.\n\n\"We have done everything we could so that the virus stays outside our farms,\" said Bart Jan Oplaat, chairman of the Dutch Union of poultry farmers. The rules in France, the second largest poultry producer in the EU, are very similar.\n\nThe outbreaks are also devastating among wild birds, explains Ruud van Beusekom, spokesperson of Vogelbescherming Nederland, an organization of Dutch bird conservationists.\n\nHe is especially worried about the population of sandwich terns, a species has been on the red list of endangered species in the Netherlands even before the bird flu outbreaks. As the population was beginning to recover, 25,000 sandwich terns died this year because of the flu.\n\nPlay Video\n2:34 min\nBird flu threatens African Penguins\nQuarantine measures also for farmer families\n\nBut a solution is not in sight. Measures like quarantines and early cullings of animals on the farms can lower the threat of a spread – but they cannot contain it completely. The Visschers have also had to keep all their animals inside, after a duck farm nearby caught the virus.\n\nThe ducks themselves were inside before the outbreak. Some poultry farmers are even reducing their own activities outside of their farms to make sure they don't bring the virus to their animals, according to Oplaat of the Union of Poultry Farmers. Children playing at different houses or farms have to shower right away, when they get home, for example.\n\nAnother idea among Dutch farmers: Nets that collect feathers and other particles that could contain the virus from the air. Oplaat reported that two farms with these nets still had an outbreak of bird flu. And it will take some years until a proper vaccine is available. EFSA will soon start to collect data to assess vaccination strategies at least until July 2023 and trials to test bird flu vaccines have already started in France and the Netherlands.\n\nEven if this vaccine is available, bird flu will not vanish. Wild birds cannot be vaccinated and the virus is likely to mutate further. This is also the reason why it stayed this year. In rare cases, mammals also caught the bird flu, but the risk for humans is very low, according to the EFSA. The only hope among bird conservationists and farmers is now: A vast spread of the virus leading to a high immunity among the local birds.\n\nFarmer Visscher is now preparing to host new chickens. Until the end of October, his entire farm will have to be disinfected and cleaned. New hygiene measures are to be announced; only then can new birds arrive. But when the migratory birds from Siberia return for the winter, they may bring new variants, which could change the situation again.\n\nEdited by: Nicole Goebel",

    "text": "Joint European debt, to combat an unprecedented crisis? That was the decision the EU took during the COVID-19 crisis in 2020. Back then, Germany, in the form of Chancellor Angela Merkel, made a sharp U-turn on fiscal policy. Germany had always categorically rejected joint European debt. But the overwhelming scale of the crisis, which plunged the whole of Europe into a dramatic downturn, forced a rethink.\n\nThe EU's COVID-19 recovery fund is set to distribute a total of €750 billion ($750 billion) in grants and cheap loans. It is far from clear, though, whether this will achieve the desired effect, or whether the debt will ever be repaid, as Merkel and Co. promised.\n\nJoint debt, guaranteed primarily by the most economically powerful member states, was to be an absolute exception.\n\nFree pass from Berlin\n\nUntil today, that is. At the EU finance ministers' meeting in Luxembourg, more and more member states, as well as two EU commissioners, called for \"European solidarity,\" i.e., more debt at the EU level.\n\nThere is increasing fear, even panic, that the massive energy crisis caused by Russia could force industrial production in Europe into meltdown. And debt-ridden governments are realizing that they simply do not have the fiscal means to offer companies and electorates in their own countries any relief from soaring prices.\n\nInstead of saving, developing new sources of energy, and preparing their populations for hard times, it is, predictably, more convenient to appeal to Europe, that is to the economically stronger states — above all Germany.\n\nDW's Europe correspondent Bernd Riegert\n\nGermany's comparatively inexperienced finance minister, Christian Lindner, has also just given them an excuse to do so. Last Thursday, responding to domestic political needs alongside Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Economics Minister Robert Habeck, Lindner announced a €200 billion relief package for the German economy.\n\nContrary to all that he had sworn in the past, Lindner agreed, as part of Germany's ruling coalition, to take on more debt in order to steer Germany through the energy crisis. This \"double whammy,\" as Chancellor Scholz calls it in his comic-book language, has naturally prompted feelings of covetousness among Germany's European neighbors. Instead of putting the money toward this \"Made in Germany\" rescue package — it is still unclear how it will actually work — Germany could have used it to help the EU they say.\n\nOrban and Meloni, of all people\n\nCould it? Should it? No! The energy crisis cannot be compared with the COVID-19 crisis. It goes much deeper, will be much more expensive, and is not about to go away. COVID-19 simply created a shortfall in demand; at some point it will be over.\n\nExtremely expensive energy scarcity, however, will continue long after Vladimir Putin has — hopefully — lost his war. And, unlike in the COVID-19 crisis, neither the state nor Europe will be able to protect people from the drastic consequences of the recession Putin has triggered. It is going to cost us, in terms of prosperity and living standards.\n\nMinister for Economic Affairs Habeck, Chancellor Scholz and Finance Minister Lindner announce the 'double whammy'\n\nEU finance ministers promised to coordinate rescue measures and not subsidize their own industries in a way that would damage competition. There is little sign of this actually happening. Confronted with this mega-crisis, everyone is looking out for themselves.\n\nIt's pretty brazen of Giorgia Meloni, Italy's far-right prime-minister-in-waiting, and Hungary's anti-EU autocrat Viktor Orban to now claim European — read German — money. Italy announced rescue packages of its own long ago, and is already collecting €200 billion from the COVID-19 recovery fund. Meanwhile, Hungary is still getting cheap gas and oil from Russia while continuing to rage against sanctions. In this crisis, Putin's friend Viktor Orban doesn't deserve a single European cent!\n\nThe economic crisis will come to a head over the coming months if Russia's nonsensical war against Ukraine continues. Pressure will grow on the German finance minister to execute another U-turn and also agree to European debt, with unforeseeable consequences.\n\nThe EU has questions to answer\n\nBut first, European governments should instead focus on buying energy collectively, not outbidding each other in markets gone wild. They should also join forces to do all they can to skim off European corporations' excess profits and redistribute the proceeds. That would be a good start to European solidarity.\n\nIn addition, European leaders must finally grapple with how they would handle a gas or electricity shortage within the borderless single market. What happens if Germany, for instance, a gas transit country, receives too little gas to keep supplying its neighbors?\n\nSuch concrete questions of European solidarity demand that politicians now find real answers. Simply calling on Germany to act as paymaster is no help at all.\n\nThis article has been translated from German.",

Research has found that methane emissions are 80 times worse than carbon dioxide emissions over a 20 year scale — and that they already account for roughly 30% of global warming. Human activity over the past 150 years has prompted a huge rise in artificial greenhouse gas emissions, causing global temperatures to soar at an alarming rate. Data show that the impact of a man-made climate crisis from greenhouse gas emissions is already being felt around the world — including in Germany.

The long-term impact of the explosion is hard to quantify.\n\nʺAccording to our current knowledge, the leaks in the Nord Stream pipeline do not pose any serious threat to the marine environment of the Baltic Sea,ʺ a spokesperson for Germany's Environment Ministry told DW.\n\nExperts say the long-term climate impact of the emissions will be substantial.\n\nʺThe most direct effect of these gas leaks on climate is the extra dollop of the powerful greenhouse gas methane they are adding to the atmosphere,ʺ Dave Reay, executive director of the University of Edinburgh’s Climate Change Institute, said in a statement.\n\nʺThat said, this is a wee bubble in the ocean compared to the huge amounts of so-called 'fugitive methane' that are emitted every day around the world due to things like fracking, coal mining and oil extraction,ʺ he said.\n\nThe scale of the Nord Stream gas leaks is not yet known. Neither pipeline was in operation, but both contained natural gas.\n\nPlay Video\n0:00 min\nWhat's behind the Nord Stream pipeline leaks?\nNatural gas leaks are an environmental hazard\n\nThe gas from the Nord Stream pipeline leaks would have been burned for energy use regardless of the leak, so it is unlikely that more emissions were released than normal.\n\nMethane is the main component of natural gas and significantly more harmful than carbon dioxide, the biggest contributor to climate change. \n\nThe only reason methane is not the biggest contributor to the warming of our planet is because there is far less of it in our atmosphere than CO2 — only about 0.00017%, or 1.7 parts per million. There’s around 200 times more CO2 floating around.\n\nResearch has found that methane emissions are 80 times worse than carbon dioxide emissions over a 20 year scale — and that they already account for roughly 30% of global warming.\n\nMethane contributes to climate crisis via greenhouse effect\n\nGreenhouse gases such as methane act as a blanket insulating the Earth. They absorb energy and slow the rate at which heat leaves the planet through a process called the greenhouse effect.\n\nFor centuries, the greenhouse effect has occurred organically because of the natural release of methane and carbon dioxide from plants, animals and wetland areas.\n\nHuman activity over the past 150 years has prompted a huge rise in artificial greenhouse gas emissions, causing global temperatures to soar at an alarming rate. \n\nData show that the impact of a man-made climate crisis from greenhouse gas emissions is already being felt around the world — including in Germany.\n\nTemperatures have been rising year on year since records began in the late 19th century\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions increasing in Europe\n\nGlobal leaders have acknowledged that reducing methane emissions is vital to limiting global warming and averting the worst impacts of climate change.\n\nAt the UN global climate conference COP26 late last year, more than 100 nations pledged to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030.\n\n\nPlay Video\n1:59 min\nCOP26: World leaders agree to slash methane emissions\n\nGovernments in Europe have been criticized for U-turns on the pledges. Energy-related greenhouse gas emissions are currently 6% higher than they were when the conference took place less than a year ago. \n\nSince the start of the war in Ukraine, countries such as Germany have been scrambling to replace cheap natural gas imports from Russia with short-term solutions like the reopening of coal plants.\n\nWill closing Nord Stream change energy strategies?\n\nNord Stream 1 and 2 are now shut down indefinitely because of the leaks — but many countries in Europe, including Germany, rely on these gas pipelines for energy.\n\nRoughly 10% of Germany's energy comes from gas, and, although the country has stored enough to keep it going for some months, those stores will run out.\n\nIt is currently unclear how closing the Nord Stream pipelines will affect the European Union's energy strategies in the coming months.\n\nEdited by: Clare Roth",

On the fundamentals, many of the issues about realities and space time are still not answered. I expect some interesting work here in the coming years,\" he said.\n\nWork on quantum mechanics a new era for technology\n\nThe field of quantum mechanics stems from Niels Bohr and Max Planck, the two founding fathers of Quantum Theory.\n\nUsing groundbreaking experiments, Aspect, Clauser and Zeilinger demonstrated the potential to investigate and control particles that are in entangled states.\n\nTheir work on quantum mechanics has helped improve our understanding of how particles behave at the subatomic level.\n\nQuantum physicists have shown that through quantum entanglement, information can be transferred instantaneously over long distances.\n\nThey sometimes talk of teleportation, but it's usually to do with the teleportation of information — it is very unlikely that we will see human teleportation any time soon.\n\nPlay Video\nHow beaming up really works\n\nThe laureates' development of experimental tools has also laid the foundation for a new era of quantum technology, including quantum computing.\n\nMost prestigious award\n\nThe Nobel Prize is considered the most prestigious award in the fields it's awarded. Notable winners in physics have included Marie Curie, Albert Einstein and James Chadwick.\n\nThe three science prizes always take the first three days in a week of Nobel Prizes, with physiology and medicine on Monday, physics on Tuesday, and chemistry on Wednesday. The Nobel Prizes for literature, peace and economic sciences follow from Thursday.\n\nSyukuro Manabe, Klaus Hasselmann and Giorgio Parisi won the physics prize last year for their work on climate change modeling.\n\nThis year's winners receive a cash prize of 10 million Swedish kroner (about €920,000; $908,000), a Nobel medal and world fame. The prizes will be handed out at a gala dinner in December.\n\nMarie Curie and Albert Einstein are two of the most well-known winners of the Nobel Prize for physics\n\nNobel's legacy\n\nThe Nobel Prize for physics has been awarded 115 times since the prize's first year in 1901. It's gone to 218 scientists, but only four women.\n\nThe first woman to win the Nobel Prize was Marie Curie. She won it twice, once for physics in 1903 and once for chemistry in 1911.\n\nHer husband was initially awarded the prize in 1903, only accepting it under the condition that her contribution was also recognized. \n\nAlfred Nobel established the prize in his will before he died in 1896. He left the majority of his money to the establishment of \"prizes to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind\" in physics, chemistry, medicine, literature and peace.\"\n\nNobel, the inventor of dynamite and military explosives, famously established the prize so he could leave a better legacy after being criticized for \"finding ways to kill more people faster than ever before.\" That's what a journalist wrote in an obituary published eight years before Nobel's actual death. The article was mistakenly published after the death of Nobel's brother.\n\nThe first Nobel Prize in physics was awarded to German scientist Wilhelm Röntgen for his discovery of X-ray technology.\n\nEdited by: Natalie Muller",

    "text": "There's a reason why carbon dioxide has become the bogeyman of the climate crisis, considering just how much of it we've pumped into the atmosphere. We haven't stopped at CO2, however. Oh no, we've added methane into the toxic mix. While the gas, also known as CH4, has become almost synonymous with cattle flatulence, there's actually much more to it than that. And it's nothing like as funny as a fart. Or a burp, which are the bigger bodily offenders. \n\nScientists estimate that although methane only accounts for 3% of emissions since 1750, it is linked to as much as 23% of historic warming. In other words, the stuff is potent. Really potent. As in, a single ton of methane causes roughly the equivalent warming of at least 28 tons of CO2 over the course of a century. And in the last two decades alone, we've managed to increase our output by 10%. \n\nReducing the amount that seeps into the atmosphere could be a secret weapon in the climate fight. In fact it could, according to a UN Environmental Programme (UNEP) report , avoid 0.3 degrees Celsius of warming by the 2040s.\n\nCapping global heating to 1.5 degrees C by 2050 is a key aim of the IPCC 2015 Paris Climate Accord\n\nLet's just do that then ...\n\nIf only it were that simple. Methane is not only the natural gas that supplies power stations and heats homes, it's also the stuff that wafts from landfills, rice paddies, the intestines of ruminants, wetlands, and in some instances, supposedly \"green\" hydropower reservoirs. \n\nAll told, the world emits 570 million tons of CH4 a year. We humans are responsible for 60% of that, with the gold medal going to farming. Partly, but not only, as a result of gassy livestock, the agricultural sector causes the same amount of warming as 788 million cars, which is more than half of the world's 1.4 billion-strong fleet. \n\nSilver goes to none other than the fossil fuel industry, with the waste sector snatching bronze.\n\nFossil fuel infrastructure is a major, and avoidable, source of methane. Damaged and poorly maintained gas pipes leak the gas through patchable holes and processes, leading to what are commonly called \"fugitive emissions.\" If they were better maintained, the equivalent of 1.83 billion tons of CO2 could be saved. And what's more, the natural gas saved from patching up the leaks would more than pay for the upgrades.\n\nFossil fuel operations are a major source of methane emissions\n\nSounds like a CH4 win-win\n\nHmmm. Yes, infrastructure improvements could reduce leaks, and tracing them is becoming easier thanks to satellite imaging that detects them, thereby making it harder for fossil fuel companies to hide or deny the flaws in their systems.   \n\nAnd by the same token, recovering burnable methane from waste could be financially incentivized. Landfill gas projects across the world are already capturing methane to burn. In the US, 70% of these LFGs produce gas for electricity generation. And at least we can use methane to burn.\n\nBut that's not ideal, since it produces carbon dioxide, which, as we've already established, is the bogeyman of the climate crisis.\n\nMethane recovery system in place at a landfill in Marshall, Michigan, US\n\nWhy is it always so complicated?\n\nThat's a good one, but hang on, there's more. Because although we can change dodgy pipes, we can't exactly replumb our farmyard friends, which makes shrinking our animal's methane footprint a tad trickier.\n\nThat said, we can go some way to mitigating the problem by changing what we feed them. Something called FutureFeed, for example, does exactly that: it's a livestock feed that contains 3% Australian seaweed which has been shown to reduce emissions by 80%. Just a little bit of dietary greens cuts back on cow burps. Not bad going. \n\nAn easier option would be to change what we eat. Less meat and dairy equals fewer animals, equals fewer gases being belched out into the atmosphere.\n\nCutting down on meat can't be the answer to everything...\n\nNot everything, but it ticks a couple of boxes. But we don't need to go there now. Not when we could be talking permafrost. \n\nMost of the methane from livestock comes from the burps of ruminants like cows and lamb\n\nPermawhat?\n\nPermafrost. Thing is, as the Arctic heats up, areas of Earth that have been locked in frozen slumber for many millennia, are starting to thaw. And as that happens, they're not only revealing pristine condition — albeit dead — big cat species lost long ago to extinction, but thousands of years' worth of methane and CO2. \n\nSome of this former icescape then transforms into new wetlands, which release methane into the atmosphere, helping temperatures to rise. Thawing permafrost could increase non-human methane emissions by 80%. And that, in turn increases the likelihood of droughts, fires, flooding and other extreme weather events everywhere around the world.\n\n\nThawing permafrosts in Siberia and nothern Canada could transform into methane intensive wetlands with a heating Arctic\n\nGreat. So where does that leave us?\n\nWith a gap between what's needed and what is actually being done. The latest IPCC report laid bare just how quickly we need to cut global greenhouse gas emissions before things get even worse. \n\nWhile it might be impossible to do away with man-made methane emissions completely, cutting them even a little could generate time enough to develop green technologies, such as low-carbon planes and ships.\n\nWhat's more, methane emitted at ground level forms ozone which can damage respiratory health. According to the UNEP, reducing CH4 output by45% could prevent 255,000 premature deaths per year.\n\nLike many climate and environmental issues, policymakers are the ones with the power to affect meaningful, lasting change. But even as individuals we can make a contribution by (whether we like it or not), cutting back on burgers, palm oil and flying. Giving these industries our money sends them a seal of approval to continue with business as usual. But that, we have seen by now, is the one thing the planet cannot afford to let happen. \n\nEdited by: Tamsin Walker\n\nThis article was originally published on September 15, 2021.

The long-term impact of the explosion is hard to quantify.\n\nʺAccording to our current knowledge, the leaks in the Nord Stream pipeline do not pose any serious threat to the marine environment of the Baltic Sea,ʺ a spokesperson for Germany's Environment Ministry told DW.\n\nExperts say the long-term climate impact of the emissions will be substantial.\n\nʺThe most direct effect of these gas leaks on climate is the extra dollop of the powerful greenhouse gas methane they are adding to the atmosphere,ʺ Dave Reay, executive director of the University of Edinburgh’s Climate Change Institute, said in a statement.\n\nʺThat said, this is a wee bubble in the ocean compared to the huge amounts of so-called 'fugitive methane' that are emitted every day around the world due to things like fracking, coal mining and oil extraction,ʺ he said.\n\nThe scale of the Nord Stream gas leaks is not yet known. Neither pipeline was in operation, but both contained natural gas.\n\nPlay Video\n16:04 min\nWhat's behind the Nord Stream pipeline leaks?\nNatural gas leaks are an environmental hazard\n\nThe gas from the Nord Stream pipeline leaks would have been burned for energy use regardless of the leak, so it is unlikely that more emissions were released than normal.\n\nMethane is the main component of natural gas and significantly more harmful than carbon dioxide, the biggest contributor to climate change. \n\nThe only reason methane is not the biggest contributor to the warming of our planet is because there is far less of it in our atmosphere than CO2 — only about 0.00017%, or 1.7 parts per million. There’s around 200 times more CO2 floating around.\n\nResearch has found that methane emissions are 80 times worse than carbon dioxide emissions over a 20 year scale — and that they already account for roughly 30% of global warming.\n\nMethane contributes to climate crisis via greenhouse effect\n\nGreenhouse gases such as methane act as a blanket insulating the Earth. They absorb energy and slow the rate at which heat leaves the planet through a process called the greenhouse effect.\n\nFor centuries, the greenhouse effect has occurred organically because of the natural release of methane and carbon dioxide from plants, animals and wetland areas.\n\nHuman activity over the past 150 years has prompted a huge rise in artificial greenhouse gas emissions, causing global temperatures to soar at an alarming rate. \n\nData show that the impact of a man-made climate crisis from greenhouse gas emissions is already being felt around the world — including in Germany.\n\nTemperatures have been rising year on year since records began in the late 19th century\n\nGreenhouse gas emissions increasing in Europe\n\nGlobal leaders have acknowledged that reducing methane emissions is vital to limiting global warming and averting the worst impacts of climate change.\n\nAt the UN global climate conference COP26 late last year, more than 100 nations pledged to reduce methane emissions by 30% by 2030.\n\n\nPlay Video\n0:00 min\nCOP26: World leaders agree to slash methane emissions\n\nGovernments in Europe have been criticized for U-turns on the pledges. Energy-related greenhouse gas emissions are currently 6% higher than they were when the conference took place less than a year ago. \n\nSince the start of the war in Ukraine, countries such as Germany have been scrambling to replace cheap natural gas imports from Russia with short-term solutions like the reopening of coal plants.\n\nWill closing Nord Stream change energy strategies?\n\nNord Stream 1 and 2 are now shut down indefinitely because of the leaks — but many countries in Europe, including Germany, rely on these gas pipelines for energy.\n\nRoughly 10% of Germany's energy comes from gas, and, although the country has stored enough to keep it going for some months, those stores will run out.\n\nIt is currently unclear how closing the Nord Stream pipelines will affect the European Union's energy strategies in the coming months.\n\nEdited by: Clare Roth",

    "text": "Self-determined. Body-positive. Woke.\n\nThese adjectives weren't common in 1950s Hollywood during the peak of actor Marilyn Monroe's career.\n\nMore often labeled \"blonde bombshell\" or \"sex symbol,\" she actually bucked some of the social trends of the mid-20th century that still strike a chord today  — and that is 60 years after she succumbed to a barbiturate overdose on August 5, 1962. \n\nOn September 28, \"Blonde,\"  Netflix's Monroe biopic, is released on the streaming platform in Europe, Australia and beyond.\n\nHaving premiered at the 2022 Venice Film Festival and been released in cinemas in the US on September 16 and in the UK on September 23, many critics have already celebrated the film, and especially the performance of the lead, Cuban-born Ana de Armas.\n\nOther reviewers, including the Chicago Sun-Times, called it \"overlong\" and \"overwrought\" and lamented that the film \"depicts Marilyn Monroe’s life as a joyless nightmare.\"\n\nBut Ana de Armas, the latest actor to embody the troubled Hollywood icon, was roundly lauded. US entertainment news outlet Variety wrote that she \"gives us nothing less than what we came for. She becomes Marilyn Monroe.\" Meanwhile, the Guardian newspaper called the Cuban actress \"simply extraordinary\" in the role.\n\nActress Ana de Armas was lauded for her portrayal of Monroe\n\nFiction, not a biopic\n\n\"Blonde\" recreated iconic Marilyn Monroe movie scenes —  including the moment when the star stood over a subway ventilation shaft that whipped up her white dress. The star's wardrobe was also faithfully recreated for the film. \n\nBut the film is mostly fictional, borrowing its title —  and inspired by —  the 2000 novel by US author Joyce Carol Oates. This Monroe story is an attempt to delve into the gap between the private Norma Jeane Mortenson (Monroe's birth name), and the Marilyn figure she created. \n\nWriter and director Andrew Dominik (\"Killing Them Softly\") has said that he wanted \"Blonde\" to play out the tension between Monroe's interior life and the \"collective memory\" of her. \n\nBeyond the two dimensional character\n\nWith her mother struggling with mental health issues and her father's identity unknown, Norma Jeane Mortenson grew up in foster homes where she was sexually abused.\n\nMonroe's troubled private life has been thoroughly dissected over the decades: Failed marriages, miscarriages and abortions, drug abuse, rumored liaisons with film studio bigwigs, as well as the Kennedy brothers. \n\nProfessionally, her come-hither looks, breathy voice — a strategy suggested by a speech therapist to overcome a stutter — and the sexuality-driven roles she landed, reduced her to a two dimensional character that pandered primarily to male fantasies.\n\nOne of the film's most shocking scenes implies that Monroe was raped by John F. Kennedy, with whom she was said to have been having a consensual affair.\n\nWhile there is no official record of this abuse, the scene works to highlight Monroe's victimization and debasement as a sex object. \n\nThe film depicts the actress's fraught relationships with the men in her life\n\nUS news site The Daily Beast called the sequence \"the most horrifying scene of the film,\" having dubbed the biopic \"a horror show filled with disturbing imagery.\"\n\nSuch scenes are likely what led to the NC-17 rating, something actress de Armas told French fashion magazine L’Officiel, she disagreed with. \n\n“I can tell you a number of shows or movies that are way more explicit with a lot more sexual content than 'Blonde',\" she said. \"But to tell this story it is important to show all these moments in Marilyn’s life that made her end up the way that she did. It needed to be explained. Everyone [in the cast] knew we had to go to uncomfortable places. I wasn’t the only one.\"\n\nAn unlikely feminist icon\n\nIn the decades since Monroe's death, she has been embraced as a feminist icon. Originally held up as an example of why feminism was necessary to counter the sexual exploitation and objectification of women, she has since been recognized for her own demands for self-determination. \nWay before Facebook boss Sheryl Sandberg rallied women to \"lean in\" and claim their rightful place at the executive table, Monroe had already warmed the seat.\n\nSigned to Twentieth Century Fox, she had grown weary of \"dumb blonde\" roles and wanted more say in the scripts and roles she took on.  She set up Marilyn Monroe Productions in 1955, becoming the second woman in the US, after Mary Pickford, to start her own production company.\n\nMonroe was tired of being typecast and set up her own production company\n\nFollowing much legal wrangling, Monroe and the movie company struck a deal that saw her successfully negotiating for back pay, a higher salary and a role in selecting scripts, directors and cinematographers — a rare victory for a female actor back then.\n\nShe called out #MeToo encounters\n\nIn \"Wolves I Have Known,\" an article Monroe authored for the January 1953 issue of Motion Picture and Television Magazine, she denounced the sexual harassment rampant in Hollywood at the time.\n\nDescribing the men in the industry, the then-27-year-old wrote: \"There are many types of wolves. Some are sinister, others are just good-time Charlies trying to get something for nothing and others make a game of it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, she was unabashed about her curves and embraced her sexuality in a way once seen as the antithesis of feminism. Today she is seen as a pioneer of body positivity. \n\nMarilyn was woke\n\nHer keen mind and informed views on politics and social justice were often also ignored. One of her most-mentioned acts of awareness was when she used her celebrity to enable jazz star Ella Fitzgerald to perform at a club that originally refused to hire her.\n\nThe Mocambo club's management apparently thought Fitzgerald lacked the glamor to perform at the Hollywood hot spot. Monroe urged club owner Charlie Morrison to book Fitzgerald, and in return promised to personally attend every show and sit in the front row.\n\nFitzgerald (left) described her supporter and friend Monroe as being \"ahead of her time\"\n\nMonroe was an \"eternal shape-shifter\" whose \"multiple transformations allow each generation, even each individual, to create a Marilyn to their own specifications,\" wrote one of Monroe's biographers, Lois Banner, a history and gender studies professor at the University of Southern California. \n\nDespite its fictional origins, \"Blonde\" dwells on the complex persona of a superstar who still resonates with the public 60 years after her death.\n\nThis is an updated version of an article that was originally published on August 4, 2022. ",

The icons of the new wave scene still have a place in the hearts of fans around the world, decades after their rise to fame in the 1980s.\n\nThe band's remaining permanent members, guitarist and keyboardist Martin Gore and lead singer Dave Gahan, announced in Berlin on October 4 that they will release a new album \"towards the end of March\" and embark on a world tour.\n\nThe band had been recording their latest album in Santa Barbara and will soon return to New York to finish it.\n\nGahan said they had \"a really good time together doing it\" and had started writing a couple years ago, before the passing of founding keyboardist Andy Fletcher, aka \"Fletch,\" who died at his home on May 26 after an aortic dissection, in which a tear occurs in the inner layer of the body's main artery.\n\n Band member remembered\n\n\"I think that it's important to say that all the songs and album title were decided before Andy passed. The album title is 'Memento Mori,' which means 'remember that you must die,'\" said Gore, who has long been the band's main songwriter. \"And it sounds very morbid, but I think you can look at it very positively, as well — Like: Live each day to the max.

Prestigious venues on the schedule include New York City's Madison Square Garden and London's Twickenham Stadium, among others.\n\nDepeche Mode got their start in the 1980s\n\nA boy band with a future\n\nThe group formed in Basildon, Essex, in England in 1980. The combination of the velvety voice of Dave Gahan with lyrics full of guilt and anguish penned by Martin Gore turned out to be a winning collaboration.\n\nYet, in their early years, the band was dismissed as synth-pop pinups: a boy band that was unlikely to last. Andy Fletcher told British paper The National years ago that Depeche Mode's original accountant only drew up a three-year financial plan, thinking the band wouldn't last any longer.\n\nThe 1981 album \"Speak & Spell,\" which spawned the hits \"New Life\" and \"Just Can't Get Enough\" and featured plenty of danceable synth melodies, put Depeche Mode at the center of the British new wave scene. \n\nDepeche Mode then went on to sell more than 100 million albums, winning over a global audience with hit singles such as \"Personal Jesus,\" \"People Are People\" or \"Enjoy The Silence.\"\n\nThe band's last studio album, \"Spirit,\" came out in 2017.\n\nIn 2020, Depeche Mode was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nThe band has also inspired a number of covers by artists one might not expect, such as Johnny Cash and Marilyn Manson. \n\n10 DEPECHE MODE COVERS BY FAMOUS SINGERS OR BANDS\nDepeche Mode\n\nIn the late 80s and early 90s, the British synthpop band offered the world a number of notable hits.

Here are 10 direct tributes to the influential band - some more memorable than others.\n\n\n\n1234567891011\nBig in Germany\n\nDepeche Mode were also highly successful in West Germany when the band burst on the scene in the early 1980s. After all, fans had already gotten used to other synth-heavy German bands like Tangerine Dream and Kraftwerk.\n\nIn 1984, \"People are People\" was used as the theme song for Germany's TV coverage of the Summer Olympics, which helped make it a hit.\n\nApparently the band was so popular with German magazine Bravo and its TV affiliate that the publication would make up stories when an interview was refused, according to a BBC report.\n\nSpeaking to an NME journalist in West Germany in 1984, Andy Fletcher said: \"The last time we refused an interview with them, they made up a story about Dave having to be carried off stage at the end of every performance, taken to a separate dressing room and kept supplied with constant fluids.

    "text": "Pictures of dead wild birds' carcasses, people in white suits carrying dead poultry out of barns – these are not new to anyone involved in poultry farming or bird conservation all across Europe.\n\nPoultry farmer Alrik Visscher from Dalfsen in the eastern part of the Netherlands is one of the farmers who has lost all his birds because of the flu. Visscher runs a family farm together with his parents, where four of his barns are now empty. Normally, up to 115,000 chickens would be walking around here, picking grain and laying eggs. Now, the Visschers are cleaning and disinfecting everything.\n\nIt was August 1 when Visscher discovered the first signs of the bird flu in some of his birds: They were quieter, blinking, some already dead. Just a day later, all the other chickens were culled as a protective measure.\n\n\"It's a mess what you feel: You feel sad, but you also feel: We have to do it like this,\" Visscher remembers. \"Because you have so many chickens, you don't think you have bond with them. But then you're gonna discover that.\" Not only emotionally, but also financially the farmers are hit badly. They lost all their sources of income. \n\nAlrik Visscher and his parents has lost all their chickens, depriving the family of all sources of income\n\nCurrent bird flu season does not end\n\nThere have been regular outbreaks of this sickness, which is deadly for many birds, for more than year, though normally, the bird flu season in Europe lasts from October until April or May. Poultry farmers, bird conservationists and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) all claim that this epidemic season is exceptional. In the Netherlands alone, more than 4 million chickens and ducks had to be culled, while hundreds of thousands wild birds have died.\n\nBarely any European country escaped cases of bird flu among wild birds or poultry since the beginning of this season in October 2021. What's new is that colony-breeding wild bird populations along the northwestern coasts of Europe are affected, according to the EFSA's latest report.\n\nBut also in the US, new outbreaks have been registered every other day. Just like in the Netherlands, where the density of poultry farms is among the highest in Europe. According to the EFSA, high poultry density is one of the factors leading to a faster spread of the virus, which usually comes from Asia via migratory wild birds spending the winter in Europe. When they leave in April, the virus normally leaves with them. Not this year, however: In the Netherlands, waterfowl are the most affected.\n\nOver 47 million birds had to be culled in European barns during this epidemic season\n\n'It can come from anywhere'\n\nGusts of wind carrying the feathers of infected birds, mice who touched bird droppings – It is small things like these that can bring the virus into the barns of poultry farmers. Although the countries have introduced tight hygiene measures, outbreaks have not stopped.\n\nBetween October and July, no chickens were allowed to go outside in the whole of the Netherlands, a quarantine that is still in place in huge parts of the country.\n\nA positive test at one farm leads to the installation of a 3-kilometer-wide-protection zone in which all farms have to prove they have no bird flu – and at affected farms all birds are culled as the virus is highly infectious. It kills fast, as Visscher had to find out. On the first day, he found 10 dead chickens, but the next day there were already hundreds of them.\n\n\"We have done everything we could so that the virus stays outside our farms,\" said Bart Jan Oplaat, chairman of the Dutch Union of poultry farmers. The rules in France, the second largest poultry producer in the EU, are very similar.\n\nThe outbreaks are also devastating among wild birds, explains Ruud van Beusekom, spokesperson of Vogelbescherming Nederland, an organization of Dutch bird conservationists.\n\nHe is especially worried about the population of sandwich terns, a species has been on the red list of endangered species in the Netherlands even before the bird flu outbreaks. As the population was beginning to recover, 25,000 sandwich terns died this year because of the flu.\n\nPlay Video\nBird flu threatens African Penguins\nQuarantine measures also for farmer families\n\nBut a solution is not in sight. Measures like quarantines and early cullings of animals on the farms can lower the threat of a spread – but they cannot contain it completely. The Visschers have also had to keep all their animals inside, after a duck farm nearby caught the virus.\n\nThe ducks themselves were inside before the outbreak. Some poultry farmers are even reducing their own activities outside of their farms to make sure they don't bring the virus to their animals, according to Oplaat of the Union of Poultry Farmers. Children playing at different houses or farms have to shower right away, when they get home, for example.\n\nAnother idea among Dutch farmers: Nets that collect feathers and other particles that could contain the virus from the air. Oplaat reported that two farms with these nets still had an outbreak of bird flu. And it will take some years until a proper vaccine is available. EFSA will soon start to collect data to assess vaccination strategies at least until July 2023 and trials to test bird flu vaccines have already started in France and the Netherlands.\n\nEven if this vaccine is available, bird flu will not vanish. Wild birds cannot be vaccinated and the virus is likely to mutate further. This is also the reason why it stayed this year. In rare cases, mammals also caught the bird flu, but the risk for humans is very low, according to the EFSA. The only hope among bird conservationists and farmers is now: A vast spread of the virus leading to a high immunity among the local birds.\n\nFarmer Visscher is now preparing to host new chickens. Until the end of October, his entire farm will have to be disinfected and cleaned. New hygiene measures are to be announced; only then can new birds arrive. But when the migratory birds from Siberia return for the winter, they may bring new variants, which could change the situation again.\n\nEdited by: Nicole Goebel",

    "text": "When Salman Rushdie's fourth novel, \"The Satanic Verses,\" appeared in its English-language first edition on September 26, 1988, the writer could not yet have imagined that this book would fundamentally change his life.\n\nNow, nearly 34 years later, numerous festivals and literary associations have invited people to solidarity readings — not to mark this year's anniversary, but because of the assassination attempt against Rushdie decades after Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa calling for the author's murder in February 1989. \n\n\"The Satanic Verses\" was first published in Britain, then in the United States, Italy and France. Muslims quickly protested against the novel and its author. South Africa, India and Pakistan stopped the import of the book; people ended up dying during demonstrations.\n\nIn London, where Rushdie was living at the time, there were also violent protests, arson attacks and threats against bookstores selling the novel.\n\nRushdie's story is about two Indian actors who survive a plane crash. One becomes an archangel; the other resembles the devil. The title of the novel refers to two verses that are said to have been whispered to the Prophet Muhammad by Satan and therefore erased from the Koran.\n\n\"The Satanic Verses\" in German\n\nIn fact, Rushdie's novel is not a critique of Islam, but a narrative about postcolonialism and migration. Rushdie later said that he never wanted to insult Islam. He could have done that in five minutes instead of working on a book for five years, he said.\n\nAlmost half a year after the novel's publication, Khomeini issued a fatwa, or Islamic legal opinion, calling on all Muslims to kill the British-Indian writer for alleged blasphemy. Rushdie immediately went into hiding, living in secrecy and under personal protection for nine years.\n\n'Fatwa led to paralysis' for German publisher\n\nKhomeini directed the death call not only against Rushdie, but against everyone involved in the publication of the novel.\n\nA quarter of a year earlier, Reinhold Neven DuMont, then head of publishing at Kiepenheuer & Witsch, had acquired the book rights for the German-language market. He later describes it as his biggest mistake not to have read the complete manuscript in advance — not because of the impending danger itself, but because he had thus not seen it coming.\n\n\"The fatwa led to paralysis in the publishing house,\" Helge Malchow, editor at the time and later publishing director, told DW. Some of the staff wanted to drop publication, if with a heavy heart, because of the life-threatening situation. \"Others wanted to defend artistic freedom and publish the book,\" he recalled.\n\nThe translator who had already been commissioned halted the project, and Kiepenheuer & Witsch refrained from the planned publication for the time being.\n\nPublic criticism of the dithering attitude was gathering steam, but Malchow cautioned that \"it was the first Islamist threat of this kind, and it caught us completely unawares.\"\n\nPublished in taz newspaper\n\nArno Widmann, co-founder of Germany's left-wing taz daily, told DW that he saw things differently.\n\n\"I thought it was a crime not to publish the book,\" he said. \n\nGerman writer Hans Magnus Enzensberger turned to Widmann's friend Frank Berberich, publisher of the culture magazine Lettre International. Enzensberger suggested Berberich print excerpts from Rushdie's book there.\n\nBut the idea was dropped because of the magazine's quarterly publication cycle. Berberich suggested printing excerpts in taz.\n\n\"I thought it was a crime not to publish the book,\" Arno Widmann said\n\nWidmann severely criticized the German publishing industry in several articles at the time. He said Germany was hiding while other countries were standing up for freedom of expression, and that these publishers were not intimidated by the protests. \n\nSo, when taz went ahead and printed the excerpts, as expected \"we received too little attention,\" Widmann said.\n\nAssassinations and brutal attacks \n\nDespite the clamorous criticism of the publishing decision, the concerns turned out to be well-founded. In July 1991, the Italian translator Ettore Capriolo survived a knife attack in Milan with serious injuries. A few days later, Hitoshi Igarashi, a Japanese translator and Islamic scholar, was stabbed to death by one or more unknown persons in front of his office at the University of Tsukuba.\n\nJamshid Khasani, who had translated \"The Satanic Verses\" into Farsi, fled Tehran in 1992 via several countries to Israel, where he settled under a new name.\n\nAfter the Turkish writer Aziz Nesin announced that he would publish excerpts from Rushdie's book, Islamists carried out an arson attack on a culture festival in 1993 because Nesin was scheduled to be there. Nesin managed to escape, but 37 people died. That same year in Oslo the book's Norwegian publisher, William Nygaard, was shot three times, an attack he survived.\n\nDecades later, on August 12, 2022, Rushdie himself survived an assassination attempt, though was seriously injured. He was on artificial respiration for a time and will suffer permanent damage.\n\nAfter years in hiding and under police protection, Rushdie has described living in New York freely and without concern for his life.\n\nPlay Video\n0:00 min\nSalman Rushdie - A marked man\nPublishing house for just one book\n\nBack in 1989, about 100 publishing houses, writers' associations, editors and authors got together to found a new publishing house that would publish \"The Satanic Verses\" in German. The idea was that no publishing house should be the sole target of possible retaliatory attacks. Kiepenheuer & Witsch was responsible for printing and distribution.\n\nThe Article 19 publishing house, whose name refers to the freedom of expression in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, served the sole purpose of publishing Rushdie's novel. The collective donated the profits of the sales to the PEN writers' association for the benefit of persecuted authors.\n\nRushdie was not happy about the collective solution; he would have preferred his publisher to take an unequivocal stance. \"He was downright outraged,\" Helge Malchow remembered, adding the writer felt the decision was like backing off from the threat.\n\nOn October 17, 1989, \"The Satanic Verses\" hit the German-language market. To this day, the person who translated the novel has not been publicly identified.\n\nBernhard Robben, translator\n\n'Concentrated hatred'\n\nBernhard Robben, who later translated several of Rushdie's works into German, told DW that, as much as he would have liked to translate the book, he struggled with the idea of living \"in fear of death.\" \n\nThe translator had met Rushdie earlier through a mutual friend, the British writer Ian McEwan. Robben was living in Oxford at the time and he and Rushdie met and got along well. But then Rushdie had to go into hiding.\n\nAfter the fatwa was announced, Robben finally agreed to translate \"The Satanic Verses.\" He recalls friends were aghast. He told them \"I can't not do it.\" \n\nIt was unthinkable to him that this book would not be published in German and that the attack on freedom of expression would succeed.\n\nIn the end, the publishing collective decided to have several translators work simultaneously so that publication would not be delayed.\n\nIn his 2012 memoir, \"Joseph Anton\" — his alias under police protection — Rushdie speculates that \"The Satanic Verses\" would not find a publisher today because the risk of attacks is greater today than back then. \n\nBernhard Robben, who co-translated \"Joseph Anton,\" is in fact \"pretty sure it wouldn't be published today.\"\n\nPEN: NO FREEDOM FOR THE WORD\nSalman Rushdie\n\nThe British-Indian author quickly earned the ire of Iran's Ayatollah after publishing his book \"Satanic Verses\" in 1988. The book makes several references to figures in Christianity and Islam, leading Ayatollah Khomeini to issue a fatwa against the writer and calling on Muslims all over the world to kill him. The book's Japanese translator was assasinated in 1991.\n\n\n\n12345678\n\nThis article was originally written in German.",

I question it because it has to be fixture-friendly with the men's team and there's a lot of things [to fall in to place for] a day like today.\" But a somewhat unforeseen effect of affordable tickets and increased demand has been empty seats at sold out games. Though several WSL clubs have sold out their season tickets for games that are, for the most part, at much smaller stadiums, there is a suggestion that some fans buy them to secure a few key games in a season and won't necessarily attend every match. \"I think we've now entered that phase of women's football becoming a business,\" said the head coach of WSL champions Chelsea, Emma Hayes, after the Euros win. \"The next step is the league leaving the FA and going to the Premier League or an independent body and that there is a vision around the women's game so we don't just have single big moments – single events once every two years or once a year – that they're every week.\" For now though, with the exception of a handful of clubs in Spain, France and Germany, it's clear the combination of money, better facilities and bigger crowds have made the WSL the destination of choice for the world's best players. \"We can now start pushing in that competition as a league, WSL, in the Champions League,\" said Williamson to DW before Arsenal snuck past Ajax and in to the group stage. \"And from our perspective that's where we should be.\"",

    "text": "For Leah Williamson, beating your biggest rivals in front of tens of thousands is becoming a habit. Two months after lifting Euro 2022 in front of 87,192 people at Wembley, she was reflecting on the impressive crowd of 47,367 that had seen Arsenal ease to a 4-0 win over Spurs 15 kilometers across London at The Emirates Stadium at the end of September.\n\n\"I think it [a rise in attendances] was on its way before COVID hit and set us back a little bit again. But now these are the people that are interested in watching, those people are fans of the game and they will come to watch us again and again and again, I hope,\" she told DW, before striking a slightly more cautious note.\n\n\"It's just got to be at the right time and that's when the sustainability of the game comes in. I question it because it has to be fixture-friendly with the men's team and there's a lot of things [to fall in to place for] a day like today.\"\n\n\n\n\nThose things are increasingly starting to happen in England. That weekend, September 24 and 25, also saw the Merseyside derby between Liverpool and Everton played in front of 27,574, meaning two of the league's top four attendances were recorded in consecutive days. Tickets for England's friendly against the USA at Wembley on October 7 sold out in less than 24 hours. Demand is clear.\n\nPay but stay away\n\nBut a somewhat unforeseen effect of affordable tickets and increased demand has been empty seats at sold out games. Nearly 6,000 people, or 11%, who bought tickets for the north London derby didn't turn up to the game itself. Empty seats in sold out stadiums were also noticeable in the Euros.\n\nThough several WSL clubs have sold out their season tickets for games that are, for the most part, at much smaller stadiums, there is a suggestion that some fans buy them to secure a few key games in a season and won't necessarily attend every match.\n\nNevertheless, the signs from a crowd perspective have been encouraging in the early part of the season, with the two bumper crowds pushing the average up to near 10,000. That will inevitably drop once fewer games are played at the bigger stadiums but crowds, in general, are up. Sustaining that is, as ever, a tougher proposition.\n\nAs Williamson suggested, crowds spiked after England reached the semifinals of World Cup 2019 only for COVID to intervene. With a World Cup following next July, there may never be a better chance to get it right.\n\nThe biggest driver of progress in England has been the increasing willingness of clubs and the country's Football Association (FA) to spend on the women's game. With Liverpool now back in the WSL after underfunding their side for years, and Manchester United finally catching up after similar levels of neglect, all the Premier League's big sides are seeing the value of their women's teams.\n\nChelsea's Sam Kerr is one of the world's best paid female players\n\nIn truth, the gulf between the genders means funding a top women's team only takes about 1% of the budget of a men's side like United, Manchester City, Chelsea or Arsenal, and the contributions don't count towards UEFA financial fair play rules. But even that 1% is out of reach for clubs outside the elite, meaning the WSL is increasingly beginning to resemble the Premier League – only rock-bottom Reading don't have a top flight men's side behind them.\n\nEmma Hayes wants Premier League takeover \n\n\"I think we've now entered that phase of women's football becoming a business,\" said the head coach of WSL champions Chelsea, Emma Hayes, after the Euros win. \"The next step is the league leaving the FA and going to the Premier League or an independent body and that there is a vision around the women's game so we don't just have single big moments – single events once every two years or once a year – that they're every week.\"\n\nThe WSL has already begun to act more like a big business, signing multi-million pound domestic broadcasting deals with Sky and the BBC and an overseas contract with DAZN that will put rival European leagues even further behind financially. While there's little doubt that the hyper-capitalist model of the Premier League is the way to bring in more money, there are some long-term questions over whether the WSL wants a system where only money really talks.\n\nFor now though, with the exception of a handful of clubs in Spain, France and Germany, it's clear the combination of money, better facilities and bigger crowds have made the WSL the destination of choice for the world's best players.\n\n\"It's really impressive how it's progressed since the Euros.\" Arsenal's Austrian international defender Laura Wienroither told DW. \"I feel like in general, in WSL the quality is a lot better. And also what's happening around social media stuff and publicity.\"\n\nChampions League elusive for English clubs\n\nBut it seems the positivity about playing in England is not so strong at one of its biggest clubs. Manchester City should have benefited more than most from the increased marketability of England's win, but they lost starters Lucy Bronze and world-record sale Keira Walsh to Barcelona, Georgia Stanway to Bayern Munich and Ellen White, Jill Scott and reserve keeper Karen Bardsley to retirement. Caroline Weir, another summer departure, knocked City out of the Champions League playoffs for Real Madrid.\n\nEnglish clubs have failed to wrestle the Champions League from Lyon and the rest\n\nWith City's Abu Dhabi owners ensuring money is no object at the club, such an exodus is puzzling and rumors that head coach Gareth Taylor is not widely respected by the players increased after a shock opening day defeat to Aston Villa followed that loss to Real.\n\nThe absence of Champions League football will hurt City's reputation if not their income. And that competition remains the final frontier for the WSL. Arsenal are the only side to have won it back in 2007, four years before the WSL was formed and almost a decade before the league went professional.\n\n\"We can now start pushing in that competition as a league, WSL, in the Champions League,\" said Williamson to DW before Arsenal snuck past Ajax and in to the group stage. \"And from our perspective that's where we should be.\"\n\nThe group stage draw on Monday means they will have to push pretty hard to make their mark. Arsenal were drawn with holders Lyon and Italian champions Juventus while Chelsea will face rising powers Paris Saint-Germain and Real Madrid. For all the hype and goodwill, the WSL will also be judged by how well it fares against Europe's best.\n\nEdited by: Kyle McKinnon",

    "text": "Paris Saint-Germain head coach Christophe Galtier and star forward Kylian Mbappe recently laughed at the suggestion that the French champions PSG take a two-hour train journey rather than a jet to Nantes for an away game.\n\nWhile the answer cast the French striker and coach in a light that does little to dispel the disconnected nature of those at the top level of football, it also raised the question of how top-level football teams are traveling to away games.\n\nThe Bundesliga is a league that has plenty of innovative climate-friendly ideas, including carbon-zero stadiums, solar-panels and even an on-site well so as to reduce water consumption.\n\nThough many fans also do their best to protect the environment, their footprint is still considerable. According to a 2020 study conducted by the climate advisory agency C02OL on behalf of German public broadcaster Deutschlandfunk, football fans produce around 7,800 tons of harmful emissions per matchday. Much has been made of the emissions generated by fans' traveling, so what about the clubs themselves?\n\nPlane, bus or train?\n\nDW inquired at each of the 18 Bundesliga clubs about their method of travel for away games. Seven clubs did not respond, three said they were unable to reveal any information as a result of either security issues, data privacy (despite the broad nature of the request) and unknown kickoff times.\n\nEight clubs did, however, release varying amounts of information about their travel patterns.\n\nBorussia Dortmund said they would travel to more than half of their away games (nine-plus games) this season by bus, while Schalke said that, so far this campaign, the club had traveled to three away games by bus and one by plane.\n\nWerder Bremen stated that last season (when Werder were in the second division) they made 10 away trips by bus, five by plane (three on scheduled flights) and two by train. They added that they always made the return journey with the same mode of transport they used for the outward leg.\n\nBoth Bochum and Frankfurt stated that they only fly in \"exceptional cases,\" with the latter citing midweek European games followed by an away game in Berlin or Munich as an example of such. The graphic below reveals how Frankfurt traveled to all of their away games in the Bundesliga last season, when the club won the Europa League.\n\nMainz revealed that last season they took the bus 11 times and flew the other six trips to away games. The club follows a rough plan of only flying to locations further than 400 kilometers (249 miles) away, and opting for scheduled flights over chartered planes whenever possible.\n\nCologne said most trips up to four hours were done by bus. Freiburg stated that games in the area around them in the south and southwest of Germany were usually traveled to on the bus, that before the pandemic, games in the west were visited by train and that longer trips, such as Berlin or Bremen, were done by plane.\n\nIndeed, the pandemic has virtually ended train travel for Bundesliga sides as a result of the risk of breaking the hygiene protocols still in place. Some clubs also stated that the unreliability of the train service ruled it out as a method of reliable transport.\n\nPlane travel out of control\n\nGiulio Mattioli, a transport researcher and expert, told DW that part of the issue is that flying everywhere has become an expectation rather than a luxury, particularly for people in affluent circles such as footballers.\n\n\"I've got this impression air travel is embedded into their life and it's an expectation,\"Mattioloi said. |Perhaps that's the most dangerous aspect: People in certain positions take it for granted — and that creates this habit effect.\"\n\nThat may have to change. The impact of flights is becoming increasingly hard to ignore. A 2022 paper on greenhouse gas conversion factors by the \"UK Department for Business, Energy & Industrial Strategy\" found that domestic flights were nine times more polluting per passenger than buses.\n\nMainz's stadium has LED lights\n\nAccording to calculations by Mattioli and his colleagues, Mbappe and Co.'s now-infamous flight from Paris to Nantes on September 3, lasted 42 minutes and emitted seven to 17 times as much greenhouse gases per traveler than the same journey by coach would have. A direct train from Paris to Nantes takes two hours.\n\n\"There has been no deliberate attempt to curb air travel,\" Mattioli said. \"More could be done by regulating domestic and private flights, and a moratorium on airport expansion would be good. If you constrain supply then demand will have to find a way to adapt.\"\n\nPhysical consideration\n\nClearly the main reason teams fly is for comfort, and indeed there is a regenerative component at play here.\n\n\"A couple things we see very often after long trips are a 'tight hips, tight back' feeling and an increased perception of pain around those areas. Considering the lower back and down are a footballer's bread and butter, it's so much nicer when time spent in that position is limited,\" Julia Eyre, a sports scientist and psychologist who works in football, told DW.\n\n\"You can definitely mitigate it [on bus or train] by walking around, but anything longer than two hours is going to be uncomfortable,\" said Eyre, who, in addition to being the athletic director at the TSG Wiesek youth academy in central Germany, also runs her own business, White Lion Performance.\n\n\"Footballers tend to have really tight hamstrings, hips and hips flexors,\" Eyre said, \"so, if you're getting on the pitch straight afterwards, teams tend to fly because they're only traveling for a couple of hours.\"\n\nIn a billion-dollar sport obsessed with fine margins, a couple of hours can make all the difference, and so it's hard to see a future in which football sacrifices regeneration for environmental protection. Clearly, there are bigger perpetuators in the field of plane pollution than football clubs, but these wealthy entities with enormous social influence must realize that their choices are no laughing matter.\n\nEdited by Chuck Penfold",

    "text": "Thailand's current constitution stipulates a term limit of eight years for a prime minister. However, there are different interpretations, depending on the political camp, as to when Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha's term should be counted as having started.\n\nOpposition parties said the ex-army chief has overstayed his tenure, which they contend started when he seized power in a military coup in 2014.\n\nHowever, since the current constitution only became effective in April 2017, Prayuth's supporters argued that the term limits cannot be applied retrospectively, and that his term officially began in 2017 when the new constitution was put in place.\n\nOn Friday, Thailand's constitutional court agreed with this interpretation, ruling Premier Prayuth's tenure began in 2017, leading the way for him to serve as PM for two more years if he is reelected after the completion of his current term in 2023.\n\nThe verdict follows the temporary suspension of Prayuth on August 24, when the court decided to hear a petition from opposition parties. The decision in Prayuth's favor threatens to exacerbate long-running political tensions in Thailand between the miliary-backed government and opposition groups.\n\n\"Even though Prayuth is coming back, it will not be easy for him to survive,\" Virot Ali, a political analyst at Voice TV, a liberal-leaning Thai television channel, told DW.\n\nPrime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha took power in a military coup\n\nThe United Front for Thammasat and Demonstration, one of the core groups in the pro-democracy movement, had promised to organize prolonged demonstrations if Prayuth was allowed to remain in office.\n\nConstitution put into question\n\nThe ruling essentially extending Prayuth's term has raised questions about the legitimacy of the Constitutional Court.\n\nAccording to Khemthong Tonsakulrungruang, law professor at Chulalongkorn University, the verdict does not indicate a constitutional crisis in a strict sense, where all parties no longer follow the constitutional order.\n\n\"But it points to the larger problem of an ill-drafted constitution, deliberately misreading the text of constitution, and the constitutional court's lack of public trust,\" he told DW.\n\nWhen the current constitution was drafted in 2017, it was done in secrecy without much public discussion, leaving many people unaware of what the prime minister's term limit is and how it should be understood, he added.\n\nThailand's political divide a generational conflict\n\nAs the face of the military coup in 2014, which ousted the democratically elected government of Yingluck Shinawatra, Prayuth is deeply unpopular with Thai liberals and progressives.\n\nAccording to Siripan Nongsuan Sawasdee, political science professor at Chulalongkorn University, Prayuth is also unpopular due to \"clear administrative management shortcomings, particularly from an economic standpoint.\"\n\nDuring his period in office, Thailand has recorded its worst economic performance in three decades. Failed reforms and the coronavirus pandemic further intensified criticism of his mismanagement and created what analyst Ali described as a \"generational conflict\" between young and old.\n\nIn 2019, young Thais took to the streets in mass protests against the government.\n\n\"One of the issues the youth wanted to push forward was political reform, which never happened. Despite the constitutional change, it is very clear that everything is designed for Prayuth to be in power. I think that is why people were feeling he must go,\" Ali said. \n\nPROTEST MOVEMENT SYMBOLS GRAB ATTENTION\nThree-finger salute\n\nIn Myanmar, people show the three-finger salute as a sign of protest against the military coup. The gesture stems from the dystopian novel and film series \"Hunger Games\" and has also been a symbol of resistance in neighboring Thailand, which has been under a military dictatorship since 2014. There, some protesters were arrested when they showed the salute.\n\n\n\n123456789\n\nPrayuth still popular with political establishment\n\nDespite his unpopularity among liberals, Prayuth remains popular with the conservative base.\n\nPunchada Sirivunnabood, political scientist at Thailand's Mahidol University, told DW that Prayuth remains the preferred leader among Thailand's pro-junta political establishment and this could have influenced the decision to extend his premiership.\n\nThailand's next general election is scheduled for May 2023 and the coalition led by Prayuth's Palang Pracharath Party has no candidate for premiership other than Prayuth.\n\nMoreover, the currently ruling coalition will want to keep opposition parties from forming a new government.\n\nThis bodes well for Prayuth's continued role within the Thai political framework.\n\n\"He seems to have everything locked and connected. The constitutional court, the anti-corruption committee, the election committee — everything is in his pocket,\" said analyst Ali. \n\nEdited by: Wesley Rahn",

It cited people familiar with the case who were not identified. \n\nThe report caught investors' attention. Twitter shares jumped nearly 13% to $47.95 before trading was stopped, climbing towards Musk's original offer valuing each share at $54.20.\n\nThe New York Stock Exchange then halted trade in the assets. \n\nA few hours later, Musk's letter to Twitter also made its mandatory appearance at the US Securities and Exchange Commission. \n\nWhy did the deal appear to be falling apart? \n\nMusk appeared for months to be trying to back out of the deal, primarily accusing Twitter of downplaying the number of suspected \"spam bot\" accounts not belonging to distinct users and individuals on the platform. \n\nTwitter's shareholders had already approved the takeover.\n\nA trial between the two parties was scheduled to start on October 17, with Twitter seeking to compel Musk to go through with the deal and Musk accusing the company of fraud in a countersuit. \n\nMusk was scheduled for a deposition hearing with Twitter's legal team later this week in preparation for the trial. \n\nRecognition that Twitter likely to win in court? \n\nObservers had commented in recent weeks that Musk appeared to be facing an uphill battle convincing the Delaware court that core information about Twitter had changed sufficiently since April to justify calling off the transaction. \n\nSome saw Tuesday's news as an indication of Musk and his entourage also coming to this conclusion. \n\n\"This is a clear sign that Musk recognized heading into Delaware Court that the chances of winning vs. Twitter board was highly unlikely,\" Dan Ives, an analyst at investment bank Wedbush, wrote in a note to investors. \n\n\"Being forced to do the deal after a long and ugly court battle in Delaware was not an ideal scenario, and instead accepting this path and moving forward with the deal will save a massive legal headache.\" \n\nEric Talley, a law professor at Columbia University, similarly told the Associated Press that Musk's about-face did not come as much of a surprise. \n\n\"On the legal merits, his case didn't look that strong,\" Talley told AP. \"It kind of seemed like a pretty simple buyer's remorse case.\" \n\nMusk's own Twitter activities in recent focus\n\nThe news also coincides with the outspoken billionaire attracting negative attention for comments about Russia's invasion of Ukraine, posted on Twitter.\n\nMusk posted a poll on Monday asking if people approved of a proposed ceasefire framework under which Crimea would be \"formally part of Russia, as it had been since 1783 (until Krushchev's mistake),\" and the recent so-called referendums in other partially occupied regions would be rerun \"under UN supervision,\" with Russia leaving \"if that is the will of the people.\" \n\n\"This is highly likely to be the outcome in the end — just a question of how many die before then,\" Musk wrote. \n\nThe post prompted highly critical responses from Ukrainian officials in particular, including the ambassador to Germany, Andriiy Melnyk. The account for Ukraine's parliament responded with one word: \"No.\" \n\nmsh/rt (AP, dpa, Reuters)",

Nevertheless, this was one of the great defensive performances from a player defying his age as well as the attackers in front of him.\n\n\"Makoto is an example to us all,\" Kevin Trapp told Amazon after the 0-0 draw.\n\n\"Today, against Harry Kane, he's probably physically not as strong but he had him under control,\" Trapp continued.\n\n\"You know you can give him the ball and he gives the team the confidence it needs. He's a hugely important player for us who nearly retired twice, but thankfully didn't.\"\n\nIt is quite remarkable that Frankfurt can confidently rely on a 38-year-old to marshal one of the most successful goalscorers in Premier League history. And yet in many ways it speaks to the unity that has become Frankfurt's superpower in recent years.\n\nThis is not a team led by one or two stars, but rather a group strongest when operating together. Evan N'Dicka's tackling, Djibril Sow's presence, Daichi Kamada's dribbling, the reliability of Kevin Trapp - it always adds up, and Hasebe is just another perfect example of that.\n\nHeroic Hasebe\n\n\"At 38, he does what is needed for his body,\" Trapp said afterwards. Watching Hasebe consistently keep up and handle Spurs' attack was evidence of that.\n\nDespite having 11 attempts on goal, Tottenham finished the night with no shots on target and with Kevin Trapp not really having to make a save.\n\nHasebe, aided by N'Dicka and Tuta, was the central piece of a strong back three and the Japanese veteran, as one of the most vertical passers of the ball, often looked to convert his calmness on the ball into an attacking move for Frankfurt. It was a textbook performance, full of teamwork, tenacity and tactfulness.\n\nIndeed, Hasebe made life so uncomfortable for Kane that late on, the striker thrust out in frustration having not being able to wriggle free of the Japanese defender's attention. Kane was booked, Hasebe was left victorious again.\n\nFrankfurt did not finish the night with three points, as they did in Marseille last time out, but this was a point they full deserved.\n\n\"Son's shot was dangerous but we had chances too. It's not like we went into halftime thinking, 'Thank God' it's level',\" Trapp said afterwards.\n\nFrankfurt were however, gleefully grateful to have Makoto Hasebe to call on against a Premier League side that spent a mere €145 million more on players this summer.

US entertainment news outlet Variety wrote that she \"gives us nothing less than what we came for. She becomes Marilyn Monroe.\" Meanwhile, the Guardian newspaper called the Cuban actress \"simply extraordinary\" in the role.\n\nActress Ana de Armas was lauded for her portrayal of Monroe\n\nFiction, not a biopic\n\n\"Blonde\" recreated iconic Marilyn Monroe movie scenes —  including the moment when the star stood over a subway ventilation shaft that whipped up her white dress. The star's wardrobe was also faithfully recreated for the film. \n\nBut the film is mostly fictional, borrowing its title —  and inspired by —  the 2000 novel by US author Joyce Carol Oates. This Monroe story is an attempt to delve into the gap between the private Norma Jeane Mortenson (Monroe's birth name), and the Marilyn figure she created. \n\nWriter and director Andrew Dominik (\"Killing Them Softly\") has said that he wanted \"Blonde\" to play out the tension between Monroe's interior life and the \"collective memory\" of her. \n\nBeyond the two dimensional character\n\nWith her mother struggling with mental health issues and her father's identity unknown, Norma Jeane Mortenson grew up in foster homes where she was sexually abused.\n\nMonroe's troubled private life has been thoroughly dissected over the decades: Failed marriages, miscarriages and abortions, drug abuse, rumored liaisons with film studio bigwigs, as well as the Kennedy brothers. \n\nProfessionally, her come-hither looks, breathy voice — a strategy suggested by a speech therapist to overcome a stutter — and the sexuality-driven roles she landed, reduced her to a two dimensional character that pandered primarily to male fantasies.\n\nOne of the film's most shocking scenes implies that Monroe was raped by John F. Kennedy, with whom she was said to have been having a consensual affair.\n\nWhile there is no official record of this abuse, the scene works to highlight Monroe's victimization and debasement as a sex object. \n\nThe film depicts the actress's fraught relationships with the men in her life\n\nUS news site The Daily Beast called the sequence \"the most horrifying scene of the film,\" having dubbed the biopic \"a horror show filled with disturbing imagery.\"\n\nSuch scenes are likely what led to the NC-17 rating, something actress de Armas told French fashion magazine L’Officiel, she disagreed with. \n\n“I can tell you a number of shows or movies that are way more explicit with a lot more sexual content than 'Blonde',\" she said. \"But to tell this story it is important to show all these moments in Marilyn’s life that made her end up the way that she did. It needed to be explained. Everyone [in the cast] knew we had to go to uncomfortable places. I wasn’t the only one.\"\n\nAn unlikely feminist icon\n\nIn the decades since Monroe's death, she has been embraced as a feminist icon. Originally held up as an example of why feminism was necessary to counter the sexual exploitation and objectification of women, she has since been recognized for her own demands for self-determination. \nWay before Facebook boss Sheryl Sandberg rallied women to \"lean in\" and claim their rightful place at the executive table, Monroe had already warmed the seat.\n\nSigned to Twentieth Century Fox, she had grown weary of \"dumb blonde\" roles and wanted more say in the scripts and roles she took on.  She set up Marilyn Monroe Productions in 1955, becoming the second woman in the US, after Mary Pickford, to start her own production company.\n\nMonroe was tired of being typecast and set up her own production company\n\nFollowing much legal wrangling, Monroe and the movie company struck a deal that saw her successfully negotiating for back pay, a higher salary and a role in selecting scripts, directors and cinematographers — a rare victory for a female actor back then.\n\nShe called out #MeToo encounters\n\nIn \"Wolves I Have Known,\" an article Monroe authored for the January 1953 issue of Motion Picture and Television Magazine, she denounced the sexual harassment rampant in Hollywood at the time.\n\nDescribing the men in the industry, the then-27-year-old wrote: \"There are many types of wolves. Some are sinister, others are just good-time Charlies trying to get something for nothing and others make a game of it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, she was unabashed about her curves and embraced her sexuality in a way once seen as the antithesis of feminism. Today she is seen as a pioneer of body positivity. \n\nMarilyn was woke\n\nHer keen mind and informed views on politics and social justice were often also ignored. One of her most-mentioned acts of awareness was when she used her celebrity to enable jazz star Ella Fitzgerald to perform at a club that originally refused to hire her.\n\nThe Mocambo club's management apparently thought Fitzgerald lacked the glamor to perform at the Hollywood hot spot. Monroe urged club owner Charlie Morrison to book Fitzgerald, and in return promised to personally attend every show and sit in the front row.\n\nFitzgerald (left) described her supporter and friend Monroe as being \"ahead of her time\"\n\nMonroe was an \"eternal shape-shifter\" whose \"multiple transformations allow each generation, even each individual, to create a Marilyn to their own specifications,\" wrote one of Monroe's biographers, Lois Banner, a history and gender studies professor at the University of Southern California. \n\nDespite its fictional origins, \"Blonde\" dwells on the complex persona of a superstar who still resonates with the public 60 years after her death.\n\nThis is an updated version of an article that was originally published on August 4, 2022. ",

    "brief": "While the gas, also known as CH4, has become almost synonymous with cattle flatulence, there's actually much more to it than that. Scientists estimate that although methane only accounts for 3% of emissions since 1750, it is linked to as much as 23% of historic warming. In other words, the stuff is potent. Partly, but not only, as a result of gassy livestock, the agricultural sector causes the same amount of warming as 788 million cars, which is more than half of the world's 1.4 billion-strong fleet. And what's more, the natural gas saved from patching up the leaks would more than pay for the upgrades. And at least we can use methane to burn. Not when we could be talking permafrost. Thing is, as the Arctic heats up, areas of Earth that have been locked in frozen slumber for many millennia, are starting to thaw. Some of this former icescape then transforms into new wetlands, which release methane into the atmosphere, helping temperatures to rise. Thawing permafrost could increase non-human methane emissions by 80%. But even as individuals we can make a contribution by (whether we like it or not), cutting back on burgers, palm oil and flying. But that, we have seen by now, is the one thing the planet cannot afford to let happen.",

    "text": "There's a reason why carbon dioxide has become the bogeyman of the climate crisis, considering just how much of it we've pumped into the atmosphere. We haven't stopped at CO2, however. Oh no, we've added methane into the toxic mix. While the gas, also known as CH4, has become almost synonymous with cattle flatulence, there's actually much more to it than that. And it's nothing like as funny as a fart. Or a burp, which are the bigger bodily offenders. \n\nScientists estimate that although methane only accounts for 3% of emissions since 1750, it is linked to as much as 23% of historic warming. In other words, the stuff is potent. Really potent. As in, a single ton of methane causes roughly the equivalent warming of at least 28 tons of CO2 over the course of a century. And in the last two decades alone, we've managed to increase our output by 10%. \n\nReducing the amount that seeps into the atmosphere could be a secret weapon in the climate fight. In fact it could, according to a UN Environmental Programme (UNEP) report , avoid 0.3 degrees Celsius of warming by the 2040s.\n\nCapping global heating to 1.5 degrees C by 2050 is a key aim of the IPCC 2015 Paris Climate Accord\n\nLet's just do that then ...\n\nIf only it were that simple. Methane is not only the natural gas that supplies power stations and heats homes, it's also the stuff that wafts from landfills, rice paddies, the intestines of ruminants, wetlands, and in some instances, supposedly \"green\" hydropower reservoirs. \n\nAll told, the world emits 570 million tons of CH4 a year. We humans are responsible for 60% of that, with the gold medal going to farming. Partly, but not only, as a result of gassy livestock, the agricultural sector causes the same amount of warming as 788 million cars, which is more than half of the world's 1.4 billion-strong fleet. \n\nSilver goes to none other than the fossil fuel industry, with the waste sector snatching bronze.\n\nFossil fuel infrastructure is a major, and avoidable, source of methane. Damaged and poorly maintained gas pipes leak the gas through patchable holes and processes, leading to what are commonly called \"fugitive emissions.\" If they were better maintained, the equivalent of 1.83 billion tons of CO2 could be saved. And what's more, the natural gas saved from patching up the leaks would more than pay for the upgrades.\n\nFossil fuel operations are a major source of methane emissions\n\nSounds like a CH4 win-win\n\nHmmm. Yes, infrastructure improvements could reduce leaks, and tracing them is becoming easier thanks to satellite imaging that detects them, thereby making it harder for fossil fuel companies to hide or deny the flaws in their systems.   \n\nAnd by the same token, recovering burnable methane from waste could be financially incentivized. Landfill gas projects across the world are already capturing methane to burn. In the US, 70% of these LFGs produce gas for electricity generation. And at least we can use methane to burn.\n\nBut that's not ideal, since it produces carbon dioxide, which, as we've already established, is the bogeyman of the climate crisis.\n\nMethane recovery system in place at a landfill in Marshall, Michigan, US\n\nWhy is it always so complicated?\n\nThat's a good one, but hang on, there's more. Because although we can change dodgy pipes, we can't exactly replumb our farmyard friends, which makes shrinking our animal's methane footprint a tad trickier.\n\nThat said, we can go some way to mitigating the problem by changing what we feed them. Something called FutureFeed, for example, does exactly that: it's a livestock feed that contains 3% Australian seaweed which has been shown to reduce emissions by 80%. Just a little bit of dietary greens cuts back on cow burps. Not bad going. \n\nAn easier option would be to change what we eat. Less meat and dairy equals fewer animals, equals fewer gases being belched out into the atmosphere.\n\nCutting down on meat can't be the answer to everything...\n\nNot everything, but it ticks a couple of boxes. But we don't need to go there now. Not when we could be talking permafrost. \n\nMost of the methane from livestock comes from the burps of ruminants like cows and lamb\n\nPermawhat?\n\nPermafrost. Thing is, as the Arctic heats up, areas of Earth that have been locked in frozen slumber for many millennia, are starting to thaw. And as that happens, they're not only revealing pristine condition — albeit dead — big cat species lost long ago to extinction, but thousands of years' worth of methane and CO2. \n\nSome of this former icescape then transforms into new wetlands, which release methane into the atmosphere, helping temperatures to rise. Thawing permafrost could increase non-human methane emissions by 80%. And that, in turn increases the likelihood of droughts, fires, flooding and other extreme weather events everywhere around the world.\n\n\nThawing permafrosts in Siberia and nothern Canada could transform into methane intensive wetlands with a heating Arctic\n\nGreat. So where does that leave us?\n\nWith a gap between what's needed and what is actually being done. The latest IPCC report laid bare just how quickly we need to cut global greenhouse gas emissions before things get even worse. \n\nWhile it might be impossible to do away with man-made methane emissions completely, cutting them even a little could generate time enough to develop green technologies, such as low-carbon planes and ships.\n\nWhat's more, methane emitted at ground level forms ozone which can damage respiratory health. According to the UNEP, reducing CH4 output by45% could prevent 255,000 premature deaths per year.\n\nLike many climate and environmental issues, policymakers are the ones with the power to affect meaningful, lasting change. But even as individuals we can make a contribution by (whether we like it or not), cutting back on burgers, palm oil and flying. Giving these industries our money sends them a seal of approval to continue with business as usual. But that, we have seen by now, is the one thing the planet cannot afford to let happen. \n\nEdited by: Tamsin Walker\n\nThis article was originally published on September 15, 2021.

    "text": "Self-determined. Body-positive. Woke.\n\nThese adjectives weren't common in 1950s Hollywood during the peak of actor Marilyn Monroe's career.\n\nMore often labeled \"blonde bombshell\" or \"sex symbol,\" she actually bucked some of the social trends of the mid-20th century that still strike a chord today  — and that is 60 years after she succumbed to a barbiturate overdose on August 5, 1962. \n\nOn September 28, \"Blonde,\"  Netflix's Monroe biopic, is released on the streaming platform in Europe, Australia and beyond.\n\nHaving premiered at the 2022 Venice Film Festival and been released in cinemas in the US on September 16 and in the UK on September 23, many critics have already celebrated the film, and especially the performance of the lead, Cuban-born Ana de Armas.\n\nOther reviewers, including the Chicago Sun-Times, called it \"overlong\" and \"overwrought\" and lamented that the film \"depicts Marilyn Monroe’s life as a joyless nightmare.\"\n\nBut Ana de Armas, the latest actor to embody the troubled Hollywood icon, was roundly lauded. US entertainment news outlet Variety wrote that she \"gives us nothing less than what we came for. She becomes Marilyn Monroe.\" Meanwhile, the Guardian newspaper called the Cuban actress \"simply extraordinary\" in the role.\n\nActress Ana de Armas was lauded for her portrayal of Monroe\n\nFiction, not a biopic\n\n\"Blonde\" recreated iconic Marilyn Monroe movie scenes —  including the moment when the star stood over a subway ventilation shaft that whipped up her white dress. The star's wardrobe was also faithfully recreated for the film. \n\nBut the film is mostly fictional, borrowing its title —  and inspired by —  the 2000 novel by US author Joyce Carol Oates. This Monroe story is an attempt to delve into the gap between the private Norma Jeane Mortenson (Monroe's birth name), and the Marilyn figure she created. \n\nWriter and director Andrew Dominik (\"Killing Them Softly\") has said that he wanted \"Blonde\" to play out the tension between Monroe's interior life and the \"collective memory\" of her. \n\nBeyond the two dimensional character\n\nWith her mother struggling with mental health issues and her father's identity unknown, Norma Jeane Mortenson grew up in foster homes where she was sexually abused.\n\nMonroe's troubled private life has been thoroughly dissected over the decades: Failed marriages, miscarriages and abortions, drug abuse, rumored liaisons with film studio bigwigs, as well as the Kennedy brothers. \n\nProfessionally, her come-hither looks, breathy voice — a strategy suggested by a speech therapist to overcome a stutter — and the sexuality-driven roles she landed, reduced her to a two dimensional character that pandered primarily to male fantasies.\n\nOne of the film's most shocking scenes implies that Monroe was raped by John F. Kennedy, with whom she was said to have been having a consensual affair.\n\nWhile there is no official record of this abuse, the scene works to highlight Monroe's victimization and debasement as a sex object. \n\nThe film depicts the actress's fraught relationships with the men in her life\n\nUS news site The Daily Beast called the sequence \"the most horrifying scene of the film,\" having dubbed the biopic \"a horror show filled with disturbing imagery.\"\n\nSuch scenes are likely what led to the NC-17 rating, something actress de Armas told French fashion magazine L’Officiel, she disagreed with. \n\n“I can tell you a number of shows or movies that are way more explicit with a lot more sexual content than 'Blonde',\" she said. \"But to tell this story it is important to show all these moments in Marilyn’s life that made her end up the way that she did. It needed to be explained. Everyone [in the cast] knew we had to go to uncomfortable places. I wasn’t the only one.\"\n\nAn unlikely feminist icon\n\nIn the decades since Monroe's death, she has been embraced as a feminist icon. Originally held up as an example of why feminism was necessary to counter the sexual exploitation and objectification of women, she has since been recognized for her own demands for self-determination. \nWay before Facebook boss Sheryl Sandberg rallied women to \"lean in\" and claim their rightful place at the executive table, Monroe had already warmed the seat.\n\nSigned to Twentieth Century Fox, she had grown weary of \"dumb blonde\" roles and wanted more say in the scripts and roles she took on.  She set up Marilyn Monroe Productions in 1955, becoming the second woman in the US, after Mary Pickford, to start her own production company.\n\nMonroe was tired of being typecast and set up her own production company\n\nFollowing much legal wrangling, Monroe and the movie company struck a deal that saw her successfully negotiating for back pay, a higher salary and a role in selecting scripts, directors and cinematographers — a rare victory for a female actor back then.\n\nShe called out #MeToo encounters\n\nIn \"Wolves I Have Known,\" an article Monroe authored for the January 1953 issue of Motion Picture and Television Magazine, she denounced the sexual harassment rampant in Hollywood at the time.\n\nDescribing the men in the industry, the then-27-year-old wrote: \"There are many types of wolves. Some are sinister, others are just good-time Charlies trying to get something for nothing and others make a game of it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, she was unabashed about her curves and embraced her sexuality in a way once seen as the antithesis of feminism. Today she is seen as a pioneer of body positivity. \n\nMarilyn was woke\n\nHer keen mind and informed views on politics and social justice were often also ignored. One of her most-mentioned acts of awareness was when she used her celebrity to enable jazz star Ella Fitzgerald to perform at a club that originally refused to hire her.\n\nThe Mocambo club's management apparently thought Fitzgerald lacked the glamor to perform at the Hollywood hot spot. Monroe urged club owner Charlie Morrison to book Fitzgerald, and in return promised to personally attend every show and sit in the front row.\n\nFitzgerald (left) described her supporter and friend Monroe as being \"ahead of her time\"\n\nMonroe was an \"eternal shape-shifter\" whose \"multiple transformations allow each generation, even each individual, to create a Marilyn to their own specifications,\" wrote one of Monroe's biographers, Lois Banner, a history and gender studies professor at the University of Southern California. \n\nDespite its fictional origins, \"Blonde\" dwells on the complex persona of a superstar who still resonates with the public 60 years after her death.\n\nThis is an updated version of an article that was originally published on August 4, 2022. ",

    "text": "While a semblance of normality is gradually returning to Burkina Faso following last Friday's coup led by little-known Captain Ibrahim Traore, neighboring countries are watching the political turmoil with growing concern.\n\n\"Anyone who has been following the developments in the region for the past six years will be very very worried,\" said Mutaru Mumuni Muktar, executive director of the independent organization West Africa Center for Counter-Extremism (WACCE).\n\n\"We are seeing the threat of terrorism and extremist violence not only expanding withing the Sahelian states but moving downwards towards coastal states,\" Muktar told DW.\n\nA security expert in Ghana, Muktar pointed to increased extremist violence on the northern borders of Togo, Benin and Ivory Coast.\n\nOusted former interim President Damiba is reportedly in Togo\n\nStrong condemnation\n\nThe international community strongly condemned the coup that overthrew Lt Col Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba, who came to power on January 31, 2022, after staging a putsch that ousted democratically elected President Roch Marc Christian Kabore on January 24.\n\nWest Africa's regional body, ECOWAS, also condemned Friday's coup in Burkina Faso \"in the strongest possible terms,\" calling it \"inappropriate.\"\n\nFor Muktar, the frequent coups now becoming popular are worsening the violent extremism threat in the West African sub-region.\n\n\"This mixture of security threats should worry all of us, especially countries like Ghana along the coast, that have yet to experience direct violent extremist attacks.\"\n\nECOWAS calls for a return to democracy\n\nECOWAS, or the Economic Community of West African States, demanded the new military junta respect the timetable agreed with transitional authorities for a rapid return to constitutional order by July 1, 2024.\n\n\"I am not satisfied with the ECOWAS approach,\" Muktar said. \"In the last couple of years, we have seen the same dysfunctional approach to dealing with the issue of coups and insecurity in the region.\"\n\nAlthough Muktar lauded ECOWAS for condemning the latest coup, he urged the regional body to do more.\n\n\"What we need to see is ECOWAS go beyond the measures of sanctions and embargoes. We need to see ECOWAS activate all its protocols, especially when it comes to governance.\" \n\nExperts say Moscow is taking advantage of growing French resentment in West Africa\n\nRussia in, France out\n\nFrance and Russia have been battling for influence in West Africa, with the latter gaining support from locals who seem fed up with Paris.\n\nNews of Burkina Faso's second coup in 2022 was welcomed by Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin, founder of the private military company Wagner Group.\n\nPrigozhin, a close ally of Russia's President Vladimir Putin, quickly congratulated Traore on his successful coup.\n\n\"I salute and support Captain Ibrahim Traore,\" the Russian tycoon said in a statement, calling Traore, \"a truly courageous son of the motherland.\"\n\nMany Burkinabes greeted news of Damiba's departure by cheering, lighting fires, and waving Russian flags in the capital Ouagadougou.\n\nSome threw stones at the French Embassy. Others attacked a French cultural center in Bobo-Dioulassou.\n\nSome residents accused France of working with Damiba to conduct a coup within a coup on Saturday.\n\nFrance later distanced itself from the coup, saying it was a victim of misinformation. \n\nThe French Embassy was attacked by arsonists\n\nPraise for Captain Traore\n\n\"Sincerely, the coup was good, I myself am happy, the country was badly managed,\" a Burkinabe citizen told DW.\n\n\"President Damiba did not respect the mandate. That's why there was this event [counter-coup],\" another Burkinabe said.\n\nDamiba had accused former President Kabore of not doing enough to combat Islamist Jihadists. Captain Traore gave that exact same reason for his decision to topple his former comrade.\n\nSani Adib, a foreign policy and security analyst based in Accra, Ghana, told DW that people's expectations of coups are misplaced.\n\n\"ECOWAS citizens think coups provide you [with] a magic wand that will turn things around overnight,\" Adib said, stressing that things don't happen that way.\n\nCaptain Traore (waving) has pledged a return to civilian rule by 2024 or earlier\n\nConcerted effort needed\n\n\"I don't think Captain Traore will be able to change anything overnight. Rather, a more concerted, coordinated international approach must be taken.\"\n\nThe security expert warned that Burkina Faso cannot do this alone and urged other countries to contribute resources. \"So we are able to deal with the situation once and for all.\"\n\nAdib said it was sad that terrorists were winning in Burkina Faso.\n\n\"It's what has resulted or culminated in the coups we are witnessing, particularly in Mali and Burkina Faso,\" Adib added.\n\nRussia to the rescue?\n\nMany observers like Adib and Muktar now think any possible solution will have to come from outside Burkina Faso. There are signs that Traore could reach out to Moscow for military assistance just like Mali did.\n\n\"There has been a growing sense of frustration and fatigue, and anti-French sentiment,\" Muktar said. He added that France and other Western partners seem to be becoming unpopular and that governments in the region are looking to ignite relationships with countries that they believe will bring a new dynamic.\n\nIn addition, Adib suggested that winning the war against extremist violence would require all hands on deck.\n\n\"We are supposed to be partners in this, but when there are cracks, when there are divisions, it plays to the advantage of the terrorists,\" Adib said. \"That is why it's imperative that we bury our differences,\" he emphasized.\n\n\"We have a lot of splintered approaches.

    "text": "The European Commission's antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager on Monday signed off on the German government's plan to subsidize chemical giant BASF's efforts to generate green hydrogen at its headquarters in Ludwigshafen starting in 2025. \n\n\"This €134 million ($131.5 million) measure enables Germany to help BASF step up renewable hydrogen production capacities, thereby contributing to the greening of the chemical value chain and of the transport sector,\" Vestager said in a statement.\n\n\"The measure approved today will also help Germany replace fossil-based hydrogen in a hard-to-decarbonize industry, and reduce its dependence on imported fossil fuels, in line with the REPowerEU Plan,\" Vestager said, referring to the EU's new energy program launched in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine seeking to save energy, diversify and reduce dependence of Russian fossil fuels and accelerate some areas of green research.\n\nThe BASF project aims to provide the company some of the hydrogen it needs in a more environmentally friendly way\n\nWhat does the project involve? \n\nThe funding will support the construction and installation of a large electrolyzer at BASF's Ludwigshafen chemicals facility. \n\nThis will separate out the constituent hydrogen and oxygen parts from water. In a bid to ensure the energy-intensive process' carbon footprint is lower, it will be powered exclusively by electricity generated by renewables. \n\nThe facility aims to go online in 2025 and to produce around 5,000 metric tons of renewable hydrogen and 40,000 metric tons of oxygen per year from 2025. It aims to prevent the release of roughly half a million tons of carbon dioxide over an envisaged 15-year period in service. \n\nWhat will the hydrogen be used for? \n\nThe main reason BASF is interested in producing green hydrogen is the chemical industry's reliance on the gas for various purposes such as ammonia production and in the refining industry.\n\nAny excess hydrogen the facility in Ludwigshafen might generate would be used for projects such as hydrogen-powered buses and trains in Germany, the EU said. \n\nPlay Video\n0:00 min\nWorld's first hydrogen trains are now running in Germany\n\nAccording to analysts at Deloitte, the chemicals industry in the EU uses 10 million tons of hydrogen a year. The vast majority of hydrogen currently generated relies on burning fossil fuels to extract it, making it carbon intensive and expensive to produce.\n\nStorage and transportation is similarly difficult because of hydrogen's very low density, meaning it must be compressed and can easily escape.\n\n\"The increasing number of hydrogen projects being initiated or announced in the chemical industry is a good indicator of the interest in hydrogen, and stress the urge to act now,\" Deloitte wrote in a 2021 report titled The Potential of Hydrogen for the Chemical Industry. \"Countries outside Europe are also catching up with formalizing hydrogen strategies and projects, and demand for hydrogen in China is expected to hit 60 million tons a year by 2050.\"\n\nMuch of the world is now pursuing similar projects and governments and industry insiders hope for major gains in economic and ecological efficiency in the coming years.\n\nThe US, for instance, in June launched a policy called the Hydrogen Energy Earthshot, aiming to reduce the cost of green hydrogen by 80% within a decade, exploring nascent methods like electrolysis. Germany and Canada signed a green hydrogen deal when Chancellor Olaf Scholz visited in August. \n\nWhat other reasons did the EU give for its approval?\n\nThe European Commission, which can veto or demand alteration to most state assistance in the commercial sector if it deems the activities contravene EU rules, including those on fair competition, listed a series of factors that contributed to its approval on Monday. \n\nIt said the project in Ludwisghafen was \"amongst the early adopters of an innovative technology in its sector.\"\n\nVestager's office also said the aid would have an \"incentive effect,\" because \"the beneficiary would not carry out the investments in renewable hydrogen to the same extent without the public support.\" \n\nIt also said any impact on competition and trade would be limited, that the proposed figure matched the costs of the project, and noted that in the event of the endeavor being unexpectedly lucrative, mechanisms were in place whereby BASF would partially reimburse the German taxpayer. \n\n\"The aid brings about positive effects that outweigh any potential distortion of competition and trade in the EU,\" the Commission concluded. \n\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "text": "When Salman Rushdie's fourth novel, \"The Satanic Verses,\" appeared in its English-language first edition on September 26, 1988, the writer could not yet have imagined that this book would fundamentally change his life.\n\nNow, nearly 34 years later, numerous festivals and literary associations have invited people to solidarity readings — not to mark this year's anniversary, but because of the assassination attempt against Rushdie decades after Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa calling for the author's murder in February 1989. \n\n\"The Satanic Verses\" was first published in Britain, then in the United States, Italy and France. Muslims quickly protested against the novel and its author. South Africa, India and Pakistan stopped the import of the book; people ended up dying during demonstrations.\n\nIn London, where Rushdie was living at the time, there were also violent protests, arson attacks and threats against bookstores selling the novel.\n\nRushdie's story is about two Indian actors who survive a plane crash. One becomes an archangel; the other resembles the devil. The title of the novel refers to two verses that are said to have been whispered to the Prophet Muhammad by Satan and therefore erased from the Koran.\n\n\"The Satanic Verses\" in German\n\nIn fact, Rushdie's novel is not a critique of Islam, but a narrative about postcolonialism and migration. Rushdie later said that he never wanted to insult Islam. He could have done that in five minutes instead of working on a book for five years, he said.\n\nAlmost half a year after the novel's publication, Khomeini issued a fatwa, or Islamic legal opinion, calling on all Muslims to kill the British-Indian writer for alleged blasphemy. Rushdie immediately went into hiding, living in secrecy and under personal protection for nine years.\n\n'Fatwa led to paralysis' for German publisher\n\nKhomeini directed the death call not only against Rushdie, but against everyone involved in the publication of the novel.\n\nA quarter of a year earlier, Reinhold Neven DuMont, then head of publishing at Kiepenheuer & Witsch, had acquired the book rights for the German-language market. He later describes it as his biggest mistake not to have read the complete manuscript in advance — not because of the impending danger itself, but because he had thus not seen it coming.\n\n\"The fatwa led to paralysis in the publishing house,\" Helge Malchow, editor at the time and later publishing director, told DW. Some of the staff wanted to drop publication, if with a heavy heart, because of the life-threatening situation. \"Others wanted to defend artistic freedom and publish the book,\" he recalled.\n\nThe translator who had already been commissioned halted the project, and Kiepenheuer & Witsch refrained from the planned publication for the time being.\n\nPublic criticism of the dithering attitude was gathering steam, but Malchow cautioned that \"it was the first Islamist threat of this kind, and it caught us completely unawares.\"\n\nPublished in taz newspaper\n\nArno Widmann, co-founder of Germany's left-wing taz daily, told DW that he saw things differently.\n\n\"I thought it was a crime not to publish the book,\" he said. \n\nGerman writer Hans Magnus Enzensberger turned to Widmann's friend Frank Berberich, publisher of the culture magazine Lettre International. Enzensberger suggested Berberich print excerpts from Rushdie's book there.\n\nBut the idea was dropped because of the magazine's quarterly publication cycle. Berberich suggested printing excerpts in taz.\n\n\"I thought it was a crime not to publish the book,\" Arno Widmann said\n\nWidmann severely criticized the German publishing industry in several articles at the time. He said Germany was hiding while other countries were standing up for freedom of expression, and that these publishers were not intimidated by the protests. \n\nSo, when taz went ahead and printed the excerpts, as expected \"we received too little attention,\" Widmann said.\n\nAssassinations and brutal attacks \n\nDespite the clamorous criticism of the publishing decision, the concerns turned out to be well-founded. In July 1991, the Italian translator Ettore Capriolo survived a knife attack in Milan with serious injuries. A few days later, Hitoshi Igarashi, a Japanese translator and Islamic scholar, was stabbed to death by one or more unknown persons in front of his office at the University of Tsukuba.\n\nJamshid Khasani, who had translated \"The Satanic Verses\" into Farsi, fled Tehran in 1992 via several countries to Israel, where he settled under a new name.\n\nAfter the Turkish writer Aziz Nesin announced that he would publish excerpts from Rushdie's book, Islamists carried out an arson attack on a culture festival in 1993 because Nesin was scheduled to be there. Nesin managed to escape, but 37 people died. That same year in Oslo the book's Norwegian publisher, William Nygaard, was shot three times, an attack he survived.\n\nDecades later, on August 12, 2022, Rushdie himself survived an assassination attempt, though was seriously injured. He was on artificial respiration for a time and will suffer permanent damage.\n\nAfter years in hiding and under police protection, Rushdie has described living in New York freely and without concern for his life.\n\nPlay Video\n0:00 min\nSalman Rushdie - A marked man\nPublishing house for just one book\n\nBack in 1989, about 100 publishing houses, writers' associations, editors and authors got together to found a new publishing house that would publish \"The Satanic Verses\" in German. The idea was that no publishing house should be the sole target of possible retaliatory attacks. Kiepenheuer & Witsch was responsible for printing and distribution.\n\nThe Article 19 publishing house, whose name refers to the freedom of expression in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, served the sole purpose of publishing Rushdie's novel.

Robben was living in Oxford at the time and he and Rushdie met and got along well. But then Rushdie had to go into hiding.\n\nAfter the fatwa was announced, Robben finally agreed to translate \"The Satanic Verses.\" He recalls friends were aghast. He told them \"I can't not do it.\" \n\nIt was unthinkable to him that this book would not be published in German and that the attack on freedom of expression would succeed.\n\nIn the end, the publishing collective decided to have several translators work simultaneously so that publication would not be delayed.\n\nIn his 2012 memoir, \"Joseph Anton\" — his alias under police protection — Rushdie speculates that \"The Satanic Verses\" would not find a publisher today because the risk of attacks is greater today than back then. \n\nBernhard Robben, who co-translated \"Joseph Anton,\" is in fact \"pretty sure it wouldn't be published today.\"\n\nPEN: NO FREEDOM FOR THE WORD\nSalman Rushdie\n\nThe British-Indian author quickly earned the ire of Iran's Ayatollah after publishing his book \"Satanic Verses\" in 1988. The book makes several references to figures in Christianity and Islam, leading Ayatollah Khomeini to issue a fatwa against the writer and calling on Muslims all over the world to kill him. The book's Japanese translator was assasinated in 1991.\n\n\n\n12345678\n\nThis article was originally written in German.",

    "text": "There's a reason why carbon dioxide has become the bogeyman of the climate crisis, considering just how much of it we've pumped into the atmosphere. We haven't stopped at CO2, however. Oh no, we've added methane into the toxic mix. While the gas, also known as CH4, has become almost synonymous with cattle flatulence, there's actually much more to it than that. And it's nothing like as funny as a fart. Or a burp, which are the bigger bodily offenders. \n\nScientists estimate that although methane only accounts for 3% of emissions since 1750, it is linked to as much as 23% of historic warming. In other words, the stuff is potent. Really potent. As in, a single ton of methane causes roughly the equivalent warming of at least 28 tons of CO2 over the course of a century. And in the last two decades alone, we've managed to increase our output by 10%. \n\nReducing the amount that seeps into the atmosphere could be a secret weapon in the climate fight. In fact it could, according to a UN Environmental Programme (UNEP) report , avoid 0.3 degrees Celsius of warming by the 2040s.\n\nCapping global heating to 1.5 degrees C by 2050 is a key aim of the IPCC 2015 Paris Climate Accord\n\nLet's just do that then ...\n\nIf only it were that simple. Methane is not only the natural gas that supplies power stations and heats homes, it's also the stuff that wafts from landfills, rice paddies, the intestines of ruminants, wetlands, and in some instances, supposedly \"green\" hydropower reservoirs. \n\nAll told, the world emits 570 million tons of CH4 a year. We humans are responsible for 60% of that, with the gold medal going to farming. Partly, but not only, as a result of gassy livestock, the agricultural sector causes the same amount of warming as 788 million cars, which is more than half of the world's 1.4 billion-strong fleet. \n\nSilver goes to none other than the fossil fuel industry, with the waste sector snatching bronze.\n\nFossil fuel infrastructure is a major, and avoidable, source of methane. Damaged and poorly maintained gas pipes leak the gas through patchable holes and processes, leading to what are commonly called \"fugitive emissions.\" If they were better maintained, the equivalent of 1.83 billion tons of CO2 could be saved. And what's more, the natural gas saved from patching up the leaks would more than pay for the upgrades.\n\nFossil fuel operations are a major source of methane emissions\n\nSounds like a CH4 win-win\n\nHmmm. Yes, infrastructure improvements could reduce leaks, and tracing them is becoming easier thanks to satellite imaging that detects them, thereby making it harder for fossil fuel companies to hide or deny the flaws in their systems.   \n\nAnd by the same token, recovering burnable methane from waste could be financially incentivized. Landfill gas projects across the world are already capturing methane to burn. In the US, 70% of these LFGs produce gas for electricity generation. And at least we can use methane to burn.\n\nBut that's not ideal, since it produces carbon dioxide, which, as we've already established, is the bogeyman of the climate crisis.\n\nMethane recovery system in place at a landfill in Marshall, Michigan, US\n\nWhy is it always so complicated?\n\nThat's a good one, but hang on, there's more. Because although we can change dodgy pipes, we can't exactly replumb our farmyard friends, which makes shrinking our animal's methane footprint a tad trickier.\n\nThat said, we can go some way to mitigating the problem by changing what we feed them. Something called FutureFeed, for example, does exactly that: it's a livestock feed that contains 3% Australian seaweed which has been shown to reduce emissions by 80%. Just a little bit of dietary greens cuts back on cow burps. Not bad going. \n\nAn easier option would be to change what we eat. Less meat and dairy equals fewer animals, equals fewer gases being belched out into the atmosphere.\n\nCutting down on meat can't be the answer to everything...\n\nNot everything, but it ticks a couple of boxes. But we don't need to go there now. Not when we could be talking permafrost. \n\nMost of the methane from livestock comes from the burps of ruminants like cows and lamb\n\nPermawhat?\n\nPermafrost. Thing is, as the Arctic heats up, areas of Earth that have been locked in frozen slumber for many millennia, are starting to thaw. And as that happens, they're not only revealing pristine condition — albeit dead — big cat species lost long ago to extinction, but thousands of years' worth of methane and CO2. \n\nSome of this former icescape then transforms into new wetlands, which release methane into the atmosphere, helping temperatures to rise. Thawing permafrost could increase non-human methane emissions by 80%. And that, in turn increases the likelihood of droughts, fires, flooding and other extreme weather events everywhere around the world.\n\n\nThawing permafrosts in Siberia and nothern Canada could transform into methane intensive wetlands with a heating Arctic\n\nGreat. So where does that leave us?\n\nWith a gap between what's needed and what is actually being done. The latest IPCC report laid bare just how quickly we need to cut global greenhouse gas emissions before things get even worse. \n\nWhile it might be impossible to do away with man-made methane emissions completely, cutting them even a little could generate time enough to develop green technologies, such as low-carbon planes and ships.\n\nWhat's more, methane emitted at ground level forms ozone which can damage respiratory health. According to the UNEP, reducing CH4 output by45% could prevent 255,000 premature deaths per year.\n\nLike many climate and environmental issues, policymakers are the ones with the power to affect meaningful, lasting change. But even as individuals we can make a contribution by (whether we like it or not), cutting back on burgers, palm oil and flying. Giving these industries our money sends them a seal of approval to continue with business as usual. But that, we have seen by now, is the one thing the planet cannot afford to let happen. \n\nEdited by: Tamsin Walker\n\nThis article was originally published on September 15, 2021.

The icons of the new wave scene still have a place in the hearts of fans around the world, decades after their rise to fame in the 1980s.\n\nThe band's remaining permanent members, guitarist and keyboardist Martin Gore and lead singer Dave Gahan, announced in Berlin on October 4 that they will release a new album \"towards the end of March\" and embark on a world tour.\n\nThe band had been recording their latest album in Santa Barbara and will soon return to New York to finish it.\n\nGahan said they had \"a really good time together doing it\" and had started writing a couple years ago, before the passing of founding keyboardist Andy Fletcher, aka \"Fletch,\" who died at his home on May 26 after an aortic dissection, in which a tear occurs in the inner layer of the body's main artery.\n\n Band member remembered\n\n\"I think that it's important to say that all the songs and album title were decided before Andy passed. The album title is 'Memento Mori,' which means 'remember that you must die,'\" said Gore, who has long been the band's main songwriter. \"And it sounds very morbid, but I think you can look at it very positively, as well — Like: Live each day to the max. I think that's how we like to interpret it, too.\"\n\nGore (left) and Gahan (center) pay tribute to departed bandmate Andy Fletcher (right)\n\nGahan said that, when he heard the title, he \"liked it immediately,\" acknowledging that it took on another meaning with Fletcher gone. \"As you perform them even over years, songs always take on different forms depending on what's going on in your personal life or what's going on in the world,\" he said.\n\nThe singer said they often missed Fletch while recording in the studio. \"Many times we would joke and things would come up and of course we missed Fletch … those are the things you miss about someone, the things you kind of take for granted when they are there.\"\n\nThe band will go on a world tour in 2023, starting with a limited run of shows in North America, followed by stadium tours next summer. Prestigious venues on the schedule include New York City's Madison Square Garden and London's Twickenham Stadium, among others.\n\nDepeche Mode got their start in the 1980s\n\nA boy band with a future\n\nThe group formed in Basildon, Essex, in England in 1980. The combination of the velvety voice of Dave Gahan with lyrics full of guilt and anguish penned by Martin Gore turned out to be a winning collaboration.\n\nYet, in their early years, the band was dismissed as synth-pop pinups: a boy band that was unlikely to last. Andy Fletcher told British paper The National years ago that Depeche Mode's original accountant only drew up a three-year financial plan, thinking the band wouldn't last any longer.\n\nThe 1981 album \"Speak & Spell,\" which spawned the hits \"New Life\" and \"Just Can't Get Enough\" and featured plenty of danceable synth melodies, put Depeche Mode at the center of the British new wave scene. \n\nDepeche Mode then went on to sell more than 100 million albums, winning over a global audience with hit singles such as \"Personal Jesus,\" \"People Are People\" or \"Enjoy The Silence.\"\n\nThe band's last studio album, \"Spirit,\" came out in 2017.\n\nIn 2020, Depeche Mode was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.\n\nThe band has also inspired a number of covers by artists one might not expect, such as Johnny Cash and Marilyn Manson. \n\n10 DEPECHE MODE COVERS BY FAMOUS SINGERS OR BANDS\nDepeche Mode\n\nIn the late 80s and early 90s, the British synthpop band offered the world a number of notable hits.

Here are 10 direct tributes to the influential band - some more memorable than others.\n\n\n\n1234567891011\nBig in Germany\n\nDepeche Mode were also highly successful in West Germany when the band burst on the scene in the early 1980s. After all, fans had already gotten used to other synth-heavy German bands like Tangerine Dream and Kraftwerk.\n\nIn 1984, \"People are People\" was used as the theme song for Germany's TV coverage of the Summer Olympics, which helped make it a hit.\n\nApparently the band was so popular with German magazine Bravo and its TV affiliate that the publication would make up stories when an interview was refused, according to a BBC report.\n\nSpeaking to an NME journalist in West Germany in 1984, Andy Fletcher said: \"The last time we refused an interview with them, they made up a story about Dave having to be carried off stage at the end of every performance, taken to a separate dressing room and kept supplied with constant fluids.

    "text": "Joint European debt, to combat an unprecedented crisis? That was the decision the EU took during the COVID-19 crisis in 2020. Back then, Germany, in the form of Chancellor Angela Merkel, made a sharp U-turn on fiscal policy. Germany had always categorically rejected joint European debt. But the overwhelming scale of the crisis, which plunged the whole of Europe into a dramatic downturn, forced a rethink.\n\nThe EU's COVID-19 recovery fund is set to distribute a total of €750 billion ($750 billion) in grants and cheap loans. It is far from clear, though, whether this will achieve the desired effect, or whether the debt will ever be repaid, as Merkel and Co. promised.\n\nJoint debt, guaranteed primarily by the most economically powerful member states, was to be an absolute exception.\n\nFree pass from Berlin\n\nUntil today, that is. At the EU finance ministers' meeting in Luxembourg, more and more member states, as well as two EU commissioners, called for \"European solidarity,\" i.e., more debt at the EU level.\n\nThere is increasing fear, even panic, that the massive energy crisis caused by Russia could force industrial production in Europe into meltdown. And debt-ridden governments are realizing that they simply do not have the fiscal means to offer companies and electorates in their own countries any relief from soaring prices.\n\nInstead of saving, developing new sources of energy, and preparing their populations for hard times, it is, predictably, more convenient to appeal to Europe, that is to the economically stronger states — above all Germany.\n\nDW's Europe correspondent Bernd Riegert\n\nGermany's comparatively inexperienced finance minister, Christian Lindner, has also just given them an excuse to do so. Last Thursday, responding to domestic political needs alongside Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Economics Minister Robert Habeck, Lindner announced a €200 billion relief package for the German economy.\n\nContrary to all that he had sworn in the past, Lindner agreed, as part of Germany's ruling coalition, to take on more debt in order to steer Germany through the energy crisis. This \"double whammy,\" as Chancellor Scholz calls it in his comic-book language, has naturally prompted feelings of covetousness among Germany's European neighbors. Instead of putting the money toward this \"Made in Germany\" rescue package — it is still unclear how it will actually work — Germany could have used it to help the EU they say.\n\nOrban and Meloni, of all people\n\nCould it? Should it? No! The energy crisis cannot be compared with the COVID-19 crisis. It goes much deeper, will be much more expensive, and is not about to go away. COVID-19 simply created a shortfall in demand; at some point it will be over.\n\nExtremely expensive energy scarcity, however, will continue long after Vladimir Putin has — hopefully — lost his war. And, unlike in the COVID-19 crisis, neither the state nor Europe will be able to protect people from the drastic consequences of the recession Putin has triggered. It is going to cost us, in terms of prosperity and living standards.\n\nMinister for Economic Affairs Habeck, Chancellor Scholz and Finance Minister Lindner announce the 'double whammy'\n\nEU finance ministers promised to coordinate rescue measures and not subsidize their own industries in a way that would damage competition. There is little sign of this actually happening. Confronted with this mega-crisis, everyone is looking out for themselves.\n\nIt's pretty brazen of Giorgia Meloni, Italy's far-right prime-minister-in-waiting, and Hungary's anti-EU autocrat Viktor Orban to now claim European — read German — money. Italy announced rescue packages of its own long ago, and is already collecting €200 billion from the COVID-19 recovery fund. Meanwhile, Hungary is still getting cheap gas and oil from Russia while continuing to rage against sanctions. In this crisis, Putin's friend Viktor Orban doesn't deserve a single European cent!\n\nThe economic crisis will come to a head over the coming months if Russia's nonsensical war against Ukraine continues. Pressure will grow on the German finance minister to execute another U-turn and also agree to European debt, with unforeseeable consequences.\n\nThe EU has questions to answer\n\nBut first, European governments should instead focus on buying energy collectively, not outbidding each other in markets gone wild.

    "text": "When Salman Rushdie's fourth novel, \"The Satanic Verses,\" appeared in its English-language first edition on September 26, 1988, the writer could not yet have imagined that this book would fundamentally change his life.\n\nNow, nearly 34 years later, numerous festivals and literary associations have invited people to solidarity readings — not to mark this year's anniversary, but because of the assassination attempt against Rushdie decades after Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa calling for the author's murder in February 1989. \n\n\"The Satanic Verses\" was first published in Britain, then in the United States, Italy and France. Muslims quickly protested against the novel and its author. South Africa, India and Pakistan stopped the import of the book; people ended up dying during demonstrations.\n\nIn London, where Rushdie was living at the time, there were also violent protests, arson attacks and threats against bookstores selling the novel.\n\nRushdie's story is about two Indian actors who survive a plane crash. One becomes an archangel; the other resembles the devil. The title of the novel refers to two verses that are said to have been whispered to the Prophet Muhammad by Satan and therefore erased from the Koran.\n\n\"The Satanic Verses\" in German\n\nIn fact, Rushdie's novel is not a critique of Islam, but a narrative about postcolonialism and migration. Rushdie later said that he never wanted to insult Islam. He could have done that in five minutes instead of working on a book for five years, he said.\n\nAlmost half a year after the novel's publication, Khomeini issued a fatwa, or Islamic legal opinion, calling on all Muslims to kill the British-Indian writer for alleged blasphemy. Rushdie immediately went into hiding, living in secrecy and under personal protection for nine years.\n\n'Fatwa led to paralysis' for German publisher\n\nKhomeini directed the death call not only against Rushdie, but against everyone involved in the publication of the novel.\n\nA quarter of a year earlier, Reinhold Neven DuMont, then head of publishing at Kiepenheuer & Witsch, had acquired the book rights for the German-language market. He later describes it as his biggest mistake not to have read the complete manuscript in advance — not because of the impending danger itself, but because he had thus not seen it coming.\n\n\"The fatwa led to paralysis in the publishing house,\" Helge Malchow, editor at the time and later publishing director, told DW. Some of the staff wanted to drop publication, if with a heavy heart, because of the life-threatening situation. \"Others wanted to defend artistic freedom and publish the book,\" he recalled.\n\nThe translator who had already been commissioned halted the project, and Kiepenheuer & Witsch refrained from the planned publication for the time being.\n\nPublic criticism of the dithering attitude was gathering steam, but Malchow cautioned that \"it was the first Islamist threat of this kind, and it caught us completely unawares.\"\n\nPublished in taz newspaper\n\nArno Widmann, co-founder of Germany's left-wing taz daily, told DW that he saw things differently.\n\n\"I thought it was a crime not to publish the book,\" he said. \n\nGerman writer Hans Magnus Enzensberger turned to Widmann's friend Frank Berberich, publisher of the culture magazine Lettre International. Enzensberger suggested Berberich print excerpts from Rushdie's book there.\n\nBut the idea was dropped because of the magazine's quarterly publication cycle. Berberich suggested printing excerpts in taz.\n\n\"I thought it was a crime not to publish the book,\" Arno Widmann said\n\nWidmann severely criticized the German publishing industry in several articles at the time. He said Germany was hiding while other countries were standing up for freedom of expression, and that these publishers were not intimidated by the protests. \n\nSo, when taz went ahead and printed the excerpts, as expected \"we received too little attention,\" Widmann said.\n\nAssassinations and brutal attacks \n\nDespite the clamorous criticism of the publishing decision, the concerns turned out to be well-founded. In July 1991, the Italian translator Ettore Capriolo survived a knife attack in Milan with serious injuries. A few days later, Hitoshi Igarashi, a Japanese translator and Islamic scholar, was stabbed to death by one or more unknown persons in front of his office at the University of Tsukuba.\n\nJamshid Khasani, who had translated \"The Satanic Verses\" into Farsi, fled Tehran in 1992 via several countries to Israel, where he settled under a new name.\n\nAfter the Turkish writer Aziz Nesin announced that he would publish excerpts from Rushdie's book, Islamists carried out an arson attack on a culture festival in 1993 because Nesin was scheduled to be there. Nesin managed to escape, but 37 people died. That same year in Oslo the book's Norwegian publisher, William Nygaard, was shot three times, an attack he survived.\n\nDecades later, on August 12, 2022, Rushdie himself survived an assassination attempt, though was seriously injured. He was on artificial respiration for a time and will suffer permanent damage.\n\nAfter years in hiding and under police protection, Rushdie has described living in New York freely and without concern for his life.\n\nPlay Video\n42:36 min\nSalman Rushdie - A marked man\nPublishing house for just one book\n\nBack in 1989, about 100 publishing houses, writers' associations, editors and authors got together to found a new publishing house that would publish \"The Satanic Verses\" in German. The idea was that no publishing house should be the sole target of possible retaliatory attacks. Kiepenheuer & Witsch was responsible for printing and distribution.\n\nThe Article 19 publishing house, whose name refers to the freedom of expression in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, served the sole purpose of publishing Rushdie's novel. The collective donated the profits of the sales to the PEN writers' association for the benefit of persecuted authors.\n\nRushdie was not happy about the collective solution; he would have preferred his publisher to take an unequivocal stance. \"He was downright outraged,\" Helge Malchow remembered, adding the writer felt the decision was like backing off from the threat.\n\nOn October 17, 1989, \"The Satanic Verses\" hit the German-language market. To this day, the person who translated the novel has not been publicly identified.\n\nBernhard Robben, translator\n\n'Concentrated hatred'\n\nBernhard Robben, who later translated several of Rushdie's works into German, told DW that, as much as he would have liked to translate the book, he struggled with the idea of living \"in fear of death.\" \n\nThe translator had met Rushdie earlier through a mutual friend, the British writer Ian McEwan. Robben was living in Oxford at the time and he and Rushdie met and got along well. But then Rushdie had to go into hiding.\n\nAfter the fatwa was announced, Robben finally agreed to translate \"The Satanic Verses.\" He recalls friends were aghast. He told them \"I can't not do it.\" \n\nIt was unthinkable to him that this book would not be published in German and that the attack on freedom of expression would succeed.\n\nIn the end, the publishing collective decided to have several translators work simultaneously so that publication would not be delayed.\n\nIn his 2012 memoir, \"Joseph Anton\" — his alias under police protection — Rushdie speculates that \"The Satanic Verses\" would not find a publisher today because the risk of attacks is greater today than back then. \n\nBernhard Robben, who co-translated \"Joseph Anton,\" is in fact \"pretty sure it wouldn't be published today.\"\n\nPEN: NO FREEDOM FOR THE WORD\nSalman Rushdie\n\nThe British-Indian author quickly earned the ire of Iran's Ayatollah after publishing his book \"Satanic Verses\" in 1988. The book makes several references to figures in Christianity and Islam, leading Ayatollah Khomeini to issue a fatwa against the writer and calling on Muslims all over the world to kill him. The book's Japanese translator was assasinated in 1991.\n\n\n\n12345678\n\nThis article was originally written in German.",

    "text": "Joint European debt, to combat an unprecedented crisis? That was the decision the EU took during the COVID-19 crisis in 2020. Back then, Germany, in the form of Chancellor Angela Merkel, made a sharp U-turn on fiscal policy. Germany had always categorically rejected joint European debt. But the overwhelming scale of the crisis, which plunged the whole of Europe into a dramatic downturn, forced a rethink.\n\nThe EU's COVID-19 recovery fund is set to distribute a total of €750 billion ($750 billion) in grants and cheap loans. It is far from clear, though, whether this will achieve the desired effect, or whether the debt will ever be repaid, as Merkel and Co. promised.\n\nJoint debt, guaranteed primarily by the most economically powerful member states, was to be an absolute exception.\n\nFree pass from Berlin\n\nUntil today, that is. At the EU finance ministers' meeting in Luxembourg, more and more member states, as well as two EU commissioners, called for \"European solidarity,\" i.e., more debt at the EU level.\n\nThere is increasing fear, even panic, that the massive energy crisis caused by Russia could force industrial production in Europe into meltdown. And debt-ridden governments are realizing that they simply do not have the fiscal means to offer companies and electorates in their own countries any relief from soaring prices.\n\nInstead of saving, developing new sources of energy, and preparing their populations for hard times, it is, predictably, more convenient to appeal to Europe, that is to the economically stronger states — above all Germany.\n\nDW's Europe correspondent Bernd Riegert\n\nGermany's comparatively inexperienced finance minister, Christian Lindner, has also just given them an excuse to do so. Last Thursday, responding to domestic political needs alongside Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Economics Minister Robert Habeck, Lindner announced a €200 billion relief package for the German economy.\n\nContrary to all that he had sworn in the past, Lindner agreed, as part of Germany's ruling coalition, to take on more debt in order to steer Germany through the energy crisis. This \"double whammy,\" as Chancellor Scholz calls it in his comic-book language, has naturally prompted feelings of covetousness among Germany's European neighbors. Instead of putting the money toward this \"Made in Germany\" rescue package — it is still unclear how it will actually work — Germany could have used it to help the EU they say.\n\nOrban and Meloni, of all people\n\nCould it? Should it? No! The energy crisis cannot be compared with the COVID-19 crisis. It goes much deeper, will be much more expensive, and is not about to go away. COVID-19 simply created a shortfall in demand; at some point it will be over.\n\nExtremely expensive energy scarcity, however, will continue long after Vladimir Putin has — hopefully — lost his war. And, unlike in the COVID-19 crisis, neither the state nor Europe will be able to protect people from the drastic consequences of the recession Putin has triggered. It is going to cost us, in terms of prosperity and living standards.\n\nMinister for Economic Affairs Habeck, Chancellor Scholz and Finance Minister Lindner announce the 'double whammy'\n\nEU finance ministers promised to coordinate rescue measures and not subsidize their own industries in a way that would damage competition. There is little sign of this actually happening. Confronted with this mega-crisis, everyone is looking out for themselves.\n\nIt's pretty brazen of Giorgia Meloni, Italy's far-right prime-minister-in-waiting, and Hungary's anti-EU autocrat Viktor Orban to now claim European — read German — money. Italy announced rescue packages of its own long ago, and is already collecting €200 billion from the COVID-19 recovery fund. Meanwhile, Hungary is still getting cheap gas and oil from Russia while continuing to rage against sanctions. In this crisis, Putin's friend Viktor Orban doesn't deserve a single European cent!\n\nThe economic crisis will come to a head over the coming months if Russia's nonsensical war against Ukraine continues. Pressure will grow on the German finance minister to execute another U-turn and also agree to European debt, with unforeseeable consequences.\n\nThe EU has questions to answer\n\nBut first, European governments should instead focus on buying energy collectively, not outbidding each other in markets gone wild. They should also join forces to do all they can to skim off European corporations' excess profits and redistribute the proceeds. That would be a good start to European solidarity.\n\nIn addition, European leaders must finally grapple with how they would handle a gas or electricity shortage within the borderless single market. What happens if Germany, for instance, a gas transit country, receives too little gas to keep supplying its neighbors?\n\nSuch concrete questions of European solidarity demand that politicians now find real answers.

His work showed the genomic changes that came to differentiate humans and their closest cousins. He also showed that both Neanderthals and Denisovans contributed genes that still exist in modern humans.\n\n\"By revealing genetic differences that distinguish all living humans from extinct hominins, his discoveries provide the basis for exploring what makes us uniquely human,\" the Nobel committee said.\n\nNo scientist stands alone\n\nIt has become uncommon for the Nobel Committee to award prizes to individuals alone, but the 2022 Prize for Physiology or Medicine has indeed gone to just one person. But no scientist works alone these days — Paabo heads a laboratory, which his colleague and close collaborator, Hugo Zeberg, described as \"inspiring\" to DW.\n\n\"The scientific questions we are tackling... we live with them,\" said Zeberg by phone moments after Paabo's win. \"It's not like we leave the lab at 5 o'clock and we stop thinking about these questions. We are totally engaged with them. It is a very inspiring environment.\"\n\nTheir work has not only taught scientists more about the Neanderthals, but it is also credited with having helped modern medicine during the COVID pandemic.\n\n\"From the genome of Neanderthals, we can learn what defines modern humans. One of our big findings was that a major risk factor for severe COVID is a gene variant that has come down from the Neanderthals,\" said Zeberg. \"And we believe a million people have died [with COVID] because of that gene variant.\"\n\nWithout Paabo's sequencing the Neanderthal genome, \"we wouldn't know that today,\" said Zeberg. \n\nThe most prestigious award\n\nThe Nobel Prize is considered the most prestigious award in the fields it's presented. In previous years, notable winners in the category of Physiology or Medicine have included Sir Alexander Fleming, Ernst Chain and Sir Howard Florey for their discovery of penicillin and Ronald Ross for his discovery that malaria is spread by mosquitoes.\n\nThe science prizes are announced over the first three days in a week of Nobel Prizes, with Physiology and Medicine on Monday, Physics on Tuesday and Chemistry on Wednesday. The Nobel Prizes for Literature, Peace and Economic Sciences follow from Thursday.\n\nDavid Julius and Ardem Patapoutian won the Medicine prize last year for their work on sensing touch, temperature and pain.\n\nThis year's winners receive a cash prize of 10 million Swedish Krona (about €920,000), a Nobel Medal and global recognition. The prizes will be handed out at a gala dinner in December.\n\nAlfred Nobel's legacy\n\nThe Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine has been awarded 112 times since the prize's first year in 1901. It's gone to 224 scientists, but only 12 women.\n\nAlfred Nobel established the prize in his will before he died in 1896. He left the majority of his money to the establishment of \"prizes to those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind\" in physics, chemistry, medicine, literature and peace.\n\nNobel, the inventor of dynamite and military explosives, famously established the prize so he could leave a better legacy after being criticized for \"finding ways to kill more people faster than ever before.\" That's what a journalist wrote in an obituary mistakenly published eight years before Nobel's actual death. The article was erroneously published after the death of one of Alfred Nobel's brothers.\n\nThe very first Nobel Prize for medicine was awarded to Emil von Behring in 1903 for his discovery of a diphtheria antitoxin. He was known as the \"savior of children\" for his work with the disease.\n\nEdited by: Kieran Burke",

In a bid to ensure the energy-intensive process' carbon footprint is lower, it will be powered exclusively by electricity generated by renewables. \n\nThe facility aims to go online in 2025 and to produce around 5,000 metric tons of renewable hydrogen and 40,000 metric tons of oxygen per year from 2025. It aims to prevent the release of roughly half a million tons of carbon dioxide over an envisaged 15-year period in service. \n\nWhat will the hydrogen be used for? \n\nThe main reason BASF is interested in producing green hydrogen is the chemical industry's reliance on the gas for various purposes such as ammonia production and in the refining industry.\n\nAny excess hydrogen the facility in Ludwigshafen might generate would be used for projects such as hydrogen-powered buses and trains in Germany, the EU said. \n\nPlay Video\n2:58 min\nWorld's first hydrogen trains are now running in Germany\n\nAccording to analysts at Deloitte, the chemicals industry in the EU uses 10 million tons of hydrogen a year. The vast majority of hydrogen currently generated relies on burning fossil fuels to extract it, making it carbon intensive and expensive to produce.\n\nStorage and transportation is similarly difficult because of hydrogen's very low density, meaning it must be compressed and can easily escape.\n\n\"The increasing number of hydrogen projects being initiated or announced in the chemical industry is a good indicator of the interest in hydrogen, and stress the urge to act now,\" Deloitte wrote in a 2021 report titled The Potential of Hydrogen for the Chemical Industry. \"Countries outside Europe are also catching up with formalizing hydrogen strategies and projects, and demand for hydrogen in China is expected to hit 60 million tons a year by 2050.\"\n\nMuch of the world is now pursuing similar projects and governments and industry insiders hope for major gains in economic and ecological efficiency in the coming years.\n\nThe US, for instance, in June launched a policy called the Hydrogen Energy Earthshot, aiming to reduce the cost of green hydrogen by 80% within a decade, exploring nascent methods like electrolysis. Germany and Canada signed a green hydrogen deal when Chancellor Olaf Scholz visited in August. \n\nWhat other reasons did the EU give for its approval?\n\nThe European Commission, which can veto or demand alteration to most state assistance in the commercial sector if it deems the activities contravene EU rules, including those on fair competition, listed a series of factors that contributed to its approval on Monday. \n\nIt said the project in Ludwisghafen was \"amongst the early adopters of an innovative technology in its sector.\"\n\nVestager's office also said the aid would have an \"incentive effect,\" because \"the beneficiary would not carry out the investments in renewable hydrogen to the same extent without the public support.\" \n\nIt also said any impact on competition and trade would be limited, that the proposed figure matched the costs of the project, and noted that in the event of the endeavor being unexpectedly lucrative, mechanisms were in place whereby BASF would partially reimburse the German taxpayer. \n\n\"The aid brings about positive effects that outweigh any potential distortion of competition and trade in the EU,\" the Commission concluded. \n\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Back in 1989, about 100 publishing houses, writers' associations, editors and authors got together to found a new publishing house that would publish \"The Satanic Verses\" in German. The Article 19 publishing house, whose name refers to the freedom of expression in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, served the sole purpose of publishing Rushdie's novel. Bernhard Robben, who later translated several of Rushdie's works into German, told DW that, as much as he would have liked to translate the book, he struggled with the idea of living \"in fear of death.\" Robben was living in Oxford at the time and he and Rushdie met and got along well. It was unthinkable to him that this book would not be published in German and that the attack on freedom of expression would succeed. Bernhard Robben, who co-translated \"Joseph Anton,\" is in fact \"pretty sure it wouldn't be published today.\"",

    "text": "When Salman Rushdie's fourth novel, \"The Satanic Verses,\" appeared in its English-language first edition on September 26, 1988, the writer could not yet have imagined that this book would fundamentally change his life.\n\nNow, nearly 34 years later, numerous festivals and literary associations have invited people to solidarity readings — not to mark this year's anniversary, but because of the assassination attempt against Rushdie decades after Iranian leader Ayatollah Khomeini issued a fatwa calling for the author's murder in February 1989. \n\n\"The Satanic Verses\" was first published in Britain, then in the United States, Italy and France. Muslims quickly protested against the novel and its author. South Africa, India and Pakistan stopped the import of the book; people ended up dying during demonstrations.\n\nIn London, where Rushdie was living at the time, there were also violent protests, arson attacks and threats against bookstores selling the novel.\n\nRushdie's story is about two Indian actors who survive a plane crash. One becomes an archangel; the other resembles the devil. The title of the novel refers to two verses that are said to have been whispered to the Prophet Muhammad by Satan and therefore erased from the Koran.\n\n\"The Satanic Verses\" in German\n\nIn fact, Rushdie's novel is not a critique of Islam, but a narrative about postcolonialism and migration. Rushdie later said that he never wanted to insult Islam. He could have done that in five minutes instead of working on a book for five years, he said.\n\nAlmost half a year after the novel's publication, Khomeini issued a fatwa, or Islamic legal opinion, calling on all Muslims to kill the British-Indian writer for alleged blasphemy. Rushdie immediately went into hiding, living in secrecy and under personal protection for nine years.\n\n'Fatwa led to paralysis' for German publisher\n\nKhomeini directed the death call not only against Rushdie, but against everyone involved in the publication of the novel.\n\nA quarter of a year earlier, Reinhold Neven DuMont, then head of publishing at Kiepenheuer & Witsch, had acquired the book rights for the German-language market. He later describes it as his biggest mistake not to have read the complete manuscript in advance — not because of the impending danger itself, but because he had thus not seen it coming.\n\n\"The fatwa led to paralysis in the publishing house,\" Helge Malchow, editor at the time and later publishing director, told DW. Some of the staff wanted to drop publication, if with a heavy heart, because of the life-threatening situation. \"Others wanted to defend artistic freedom and publish the book,\" he recalled.\n\nThe translator who had already been commissioned halted the project, and Kiepenheuer & Witsch refrained from the planned publication for the time being.\n\nPublic criticism of the dithering attitude was gathering steam, but Malchow cautioned that \"it was the first Islamist threat of this kind, and it caught us completely unawares.\"\n\nPublished in taz newspaper\n\nArno Widmann, co-founder of Germany's left-wing taz daily, told DW that he saw things differently.\n\n\"I thought it was a crime not to publish the book,\" he said. \n\nGerman writer Hans Magnus Enzensberger turned to Widmann's friend Frank Berberich, publisher of the culture magazine Lettre International. Enzensberger suggested Berberich print excerpts from Rushdie's book there.\n\nBut the idea was dropped because of the magazine's quarterly publication cycle. Berberich suggested printing excerpts in taz.\n\n\"I thought it was a crime not to publish the book,\" Arno Widmann said\n\nWidmann severely criticized the German publishing industry in several articles at the time. He said Germany was hiding while other countries were standing up for freedom of expression, and that these publishers were not intimidated by the protests. \n\nSo, when taz went ahead and printed the excerpts, as expected \"we received too little attention,\" Widmann said.\n\nAssassinations and brutal attacks \n\nDespite the clamorous criticism of the publishing decision, the concerns turned out to be well-founded. In July 1991, the Italian translator Ettore Capriolo survived a knife attack in Milan with serious injuries. A few days later, Hitoshi Igarashi, a Japanese translator and Islamic scholar, was stabbed to death by one or more unknown persons in front of his office at the University of Tsukuba.\n\nJamshid Khasani, who had translated \"The Satanic Verses\" into Farsi, fled Tehran in 1992 via several countries to Israel, where he settled under a new name.\n\nAfter the Turkish writer Aziz Nesin announced that he would publish excerpts from Rushdie's book, Islamists carried out an arson attack on a culture festival in 1993 because Nesin was scheduled to be there. Nesin managed to escape, but 37 people died. That same year in Oslo the book's Norwegian publisher, William Nygaard, was shot three times, an attack he survived.\n\nDecades later, on August 12, 2022, Rushdie himself survived an assassination attempt, though was seriously injured. He was on artificial respiration for a time and will suffer permanent damage.\n\nAfter years in hiding and under police protection, Rushdie has described living in New York freely and without concern for his life.\n\nPlay Video\n0:00 min\nSalman Rushdie - A marked man\nPublishing house for just one book\n\nBack in 1989, about 100 publishing houses, writers' associations, editors and authors got together to found a new publishing house that would publish \"The Satanic Verses\" in German. The idea was that no publishing house should be the sole target of possible retaliatory attacks. Kiepenheuer & Witsch was responsible for printing and distribution.\n\nThe Article 19 publishing house, whose name refers to the freedom of expression in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, served the sole purpose of publishing Rushdie's novel. The collective donated the profits of the sales to the PEN writers' association for the benefit of persecuted authors.\n\nRushdie was not happy about the collective solution; he would have preferred his publisher to take an unequivocal stance. \"He was downright outraged,\" Helge Malchow remembered, adding the writer felt the decision was like backing off from the threat.\n\nOn October 17, 1989, \"The Satanic Verses\" hit the German-language market. To this day, the person who translated the novel has not been publicly identified.\n\nBernhard Robben, translator\n\n'Concentrated hatred'\n\nBernhard Robben, who later translated several of Rushdie's works into German, told DW that, as much as he would have liked to translate the book, he struggled with the idea of living \"in fear of death.\" \n\nThe translator had met Rushdie earlier through a mutual friend, the British writer Ian McEwan. Robben was living in Oxford at the time and he and Rushdie met and got along well. But then Rushdie had to go into hiding.\n\nAfter the fatwa was announced, Robben finally agreed to translate \"The Satanic Verses.\" He recalls friends were aghast. He told them \"I can't not do it.\" \n\nIt was unthinkable to him that this book would not be published in German and that the attack on freedom of expression would succeed.\n\nIn the end, the publishing collective decided to have several translators work simultaneously so that publication would not be delayed.\n\nIn his 2012 memoir, \"Joseph Anton\" — his alias under police protection — Rushdie speculates that \"The Satanic Verses\" would not find a publisher today because the risk of attacks is greater today than back then. \n\nBernhard Robben, who co-translated \"Joseph Anton,\" is in fact \"pretty sure it wouldn't be published today.\"\n\nPEN: NO FREEDOM FOR THE WORD\nSalman Rushdie\n\nThe British-Indian author quickly earned the ire of Iran's Ayatollah after publishing his book \"Satanic Verses\" in 1988. The book makes several references to figures in Christianity and Islam, leading Ayatollah Khomeini to issue a fatwa against the writer and calling on Muslims all over the world to kill him. The book's Japanese translator was assasinated in 1991.\n\n\n\n12345678\n\nThis article was originally written in German.",

Nevertheless, this was one of the great defensive performances from a player defying his age as well as the attackers in front of him.\n\n\"Makoto is an example to us all,\" Kevin Trapp told Amazon afterwards.\n\n\"Today, against Harry Kane, he's probably physically not as strong but he had him under control,\" Trapp continued.\n\n\"You know you can give him the ball and he gives the team the confidence it needs. He's a hugely important player for us who nearly retired twice, but thankfully didn't.\"\n\nIt is quite remarkable that Frankfurt can confidently rely on a 38-year-old to marshal one of the most successful goalscorers in Premier League history. And yet in many ways it speaks to the unity that has become Frankfurt's superpower in recent years.\n\nThis is not a team led by one or two stars, but rather a group strongest when operating together. Evan N'Dicka's tackling, Djibril Sow's presence, Daichi Kamada's dribbling, the reliability of Kevin Trapp - it always adds up, and Hasebe is just another perfect example of that.\n\nHeroic Hasebe\n\n\"At 38, he does what is needed for his body,\" Trapp said afterwards. Watching Hasebe consistently keep up and handle Spurs' attack was evidence of that.\n\nDespite having 11 attempts on goal, Tottenham finished the night with no shots on target and with Kevin Trapp not really having to make a save.\n\nHasebe, aided by N'Dicka and Tuta, was the central piece of a strong back three and the Japanese veteran, as one of the most vertical passers of the ball, often looked to convert his calmness on the ball into an attacking move for Frankfurt. It was a textbook performance, full of teamwork, tenacity and tactfulness.\n\nIndeed, Hasebe made life so uncomfortable for Kane that late on, the striker thrust out in frustration having not being able to wriggle free of the Japanese defender's attention. Kane was booked, Hasebe was left victorious again.\n\nFrankfurt did not finish the night with three points, as they did in Marseille last time out, but this was a point they full deserved.\n\n\"Son's shot was dangerous but we had chances too. It's not like we went into halftime thinking, 'Thank God' it's level',\" Trapp said afterwards.\n\nFrankfurt were however, gleefully grateful to have Makoto Hasebe to call on against a Premier League side that spent a mere €145 million more on players this summer.

Others attacked a French cultural center in Bobo-Dioulassou.\n\nSome residents accused France of working with Damiba to conduct a coup within a coup on Saturday.\n\nFrance later distanced itself from the coup, saying it was a victim of misinformation. \n\nThe French Embassy was attacked by arsonists\n\nPraise for Captain Traore\n\n\"Sincerely, the coup was good, I myself am happy, the country was badly managed,\" a Burkinabe citizen told DW.\n\n\"President Damiba did not respect the mandate. That's why there was this event [counter-coup],\" another Burkinabe said.\n\nDamiba had accused former President Kabore of not doing enough to combat Islamist Jihadists. Captain Traore gave that exact same reason for his decision to topple his former comrade.\n\nSani Adib, a foreign policy and security analyst based in Accra, Ghana, told DW that people's expectations of coups are misplaced.\n\n\"ECOWAS citizens think coups provide you [with] a magic wand that will turn things around overnight,\" Adib said, stressing that things don't happen that way.\n\nCaptain Traore (waving) has pledged a return to civilian rule by 2024 or earlier\n\nConcerted effort needed\n\n\"I don't think Captain Traore will be able to change anything overnight. Rather, a more concerted, coordinated international approach must be taken.\"\n\nThe security expert warned that Burkina Faso cannot do this alone and urged other countries to contribute resources. \"So we are able to deal with the situation once and for all.\"\n\nAdib said it was sad that terrorists were winning in Burkina Faso.\n\n\"It's what has resulted or culminated in the coups we are witnessing, particularly in Mali and Burkina Faso,\" Adib added.\n\nRussia to the rescue?\n\nMany observers like Adib and Muktar now think any possible solution will have to come from outside Burkina Faso. There are signs that Traore could reach out to Moscow for military assistance just like Mali did.\n\n\"There has been a growing sense of frustration and fatigue, and anti-French sentiment,\" Muktar said. He added that France and other Western partners seem to be becoming unpopular and that governments in the region are looking to ignite relationships with countries that they believe will bring a new dynamic.\n\nIn addition, Adib suggested that winning the war against extremist violence would require all hands on deck.\n\n\"We are supposed to be partners in this, but when there are cracks, when there are divisions, it plays to the advantage of the terrorists,\" Adib said. \"That is why it's imperative that we bury our differences,\" he emphasized.\n\n\"We have a lot of splintered approaches. MINUSMA, Barkhane, Joint Task Force, G5 Sahel, the Accra Initiative — it's indicative of the uncoordinated approach we are resorting to.\"\n\nEdited by: Jon Shelton",

    "text": "The European Commission's antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager on Monday signed off on the German government's plan to subsidize chemical giant BASF's efforts to generate green hydrogen at its headquarters in Ludwigshafen starting in 2025. \n\n\"This €134 million ($131.5 million) measure enables Germany to help BASF step up renewable hydrogen production capacities, thereby contributing to the greening of the chemical value chain and of the transport sector,\" Vestager said in a statement.\n\n\"The measure approved today will also help Germany replace fossil-based hydrogen in a hard-to-decarbonize industry, and reduce its dependence on imported fossil fuels, in line with the REPowerEU Plan,\" Vestager said, referring to the EU's new energy program launched in the aftermath of Russia's invasion of Ukraine seeking to save energy, diversify and reduce dependence of Russian fossil fuels and accelerate some areas of green research.\n\nThe BASF project aims to provide the company some of the hydrogen it needs in a more environmentally friendly way\n\nWhat does the project involve? \n\nThe funding will support the construction and installation of a large electrolyzer at BASF's Ludwigshafen chemicals facility. \n\nThis will separate out the constituent hydrogen and oxygen parts from water. In a bid to ensure the energy-intensive process' carbon footprint is lower, it will be powered exclusively by electricity generated by renewables. \n\nThe facility aims to go online in 2025 and to produce around 5,000 metric tons of renewable hydrogen and 40,000 metric tons of oxygen per year from 2025. It aims to prevent the release of roughly half a million tons of carbon dioxide over an envisaged 15-year period in service. \n\nWhat will the hydrogen be used for? \n\nThe main reason BASF is interested in producing green hydrogen is the chemical industry's reliance on the gas for various purposes such as ammonia production and in the refining industry.\n\nAny excess hydrogen the facility in Ludwigshafen might generate would be used for projects such as hydrogen-powered buses and trains in Germany, the EU said. \n\nPlay Video\n2:58 min\nWorld's first hydrogen trains are now running in Germany\n\nAccording to analysts at Deloitte, the chemicals industry in the EU uses 10 million tons of hydrogen a year. The vast majority of hydrogen currently generated relies on burning fossil fuels to extract it, making it carbon intensive and expensive to produce.\n\nStorage and transportation is similarly difficult because of hydrogen's very low density, meaning it must be compressed and can easily escape.\n\n\"The increasing number of hydrogen projects being initiated or announced in the chemical industry is a good indicator of the interest in hydrogen, and stress the urge to act now,\" Deloitte wrote in a 2021 report titled The Potential of Hydrogen for the Chemical Industry. \"Countries outside Europe are also catching up with formalizing hydrogen strategies and projects, and demand for hydrogen in China is expected to hit 60 million tons a year by 2050.\"\n\nMuch of the world is now pursuing similar projects and governments and industry insiders hope for major gains in economic and ecological efficiency in the coming years.\n\nThe US, for instance, in June launched a policy called the Hydrogen Energy Earthshot, aiming to reduce the cost of green hydrogen by 80% within a decade, exploring nascent methods like electrolysis. Germany and Canada signed a green hydrogen deal when Chancellor Olaf Scholz visited in August. \n\nWhat other reasons did the EU give for its approval?\n\nThe European Commission, which can veto or demand alteration to most state assistance in the commercial sector if it deems the activities contravene EU rules, including those on fair competition, listed a series of factors that contributed to its approval on Monday. \n\nIt said the project in Ludwisghafen was \"amongst the early adopters of an innovative technology in its sector.\"\n\nVestager's office also said the aid would have an \"incentive effect,\" because \"the beneficiary would not carry out the investments in renewable hydrogen to the same extent without the public support.\" \n\nIt also said any impact on competition and trade would be limited, that the proposed figure matched the costs of the project, and noted that in the event of the endeavor being unexpectedly lucrative, mechanisms were in place whereby BASF would partially reimburse the German taxpayer. \n\n\"The aid brings about positive effects that outweigh any potential distortion of competition and trade in the EU,\" the Commission concluded. \n\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "text": "Joint European debt, to combat an unprecedented crisis? That was the decision the EU took during the COVID-19 crisis in 2020. Back then, Germany, in the form of Chancellor Angela Merkel, made a sharp U-turn on fiscal policy. Germany had always categorically rejected joint European debt. But the overwhelming scale of the crisis, which plunged the whole of Europe into a dramatic downturn, forced a rethink.\n\nThe EU's COVID-19 recovery fund is set to distribute a total of €750 billion ($750 billion) in grants and cheap loans. It is far from clear, though, whether this will achieve the desired effect, or whether the debt will ever be repaid, as Merkel and Co. promised.\n\nJoint debt, guaranteed primarily by the most economically powerful member states, was to be an absolute exception.\n\nFree pass from Berlin\n\nUntil today, that is. At the EU finance ministers' meeting in Luxembourg, more and more member states, as well as two EU commissioners, called for \"European solidarity,\" i.e., more debt at the EU level.\n\nThere is increasing fear, even panic, that the massive energy crisis caused by Russia could force industrial production in Europe into meltdown. And debt-ridden governments are realizing that they simply do not have the fiscal means to offer companies and electorates in their own countries any relief from soaring prices.\n\nInstead of saving, developing new sources of energy, and preparing their populations for hard times, it is, predictably, more convenient to appeal to Europe, that is to the economically stronger states — above all Germany.\n\nDW's Europe correspondent Bernd Riegert\n\nGermany's comparatively inexperienced finance minister, Christian Lindner, has also just given them an excuse to do so. Last Thursday, responding to domestic political needs alongside Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Economics Minister Robert Habeck, Lindner announced a €200 billion relief package for the German economy.\n\nContrary to all that he had sworn in the past, Lindner agreed, as part of Germany's ruling coalition, to take on more debt in order to steer Germany through the energy crisis. This \"double whammy,\" as Chancellor Scholz calls it in his comic-book language, has naturally prompted feelings of covetousness among Germany's European neighbors. Instead of putting the money toward this \"Made in Germany\" rescue package — it is still unclear how it will actually work — Germany could have used it to help the EU they say.\n\nOrban and Meloni, of all people\n\nCould it? Should it? No! The energy crisis cannot be compared with the COVID-19 crisis. It goes much deeper, will be much more expensive, and is not about to go away. COVID-19 simply created a shortfall in demand; at some point it will be over.\n\nExtremely expensive energy scarcity, however, will continue long after Vladimir Putin has — hopefully — lost his war. And, unlike in the COVID-19 crisis, neither the state nor Europe will be able to protect people from the drastic consequences of the recession Putin has triggered. It is going to cost us, in terms of prosperity and living standards.\n\nMinister for Economic Affairs Habeck, Chancellor Scholz and Finance Minister Lindner announce the 'double whammy'\n\nEU finance ministers promised to coordinate rescue measures and not subsidize their own industries in a way that would damage competition. There is little sign of this actually happening. Confronted with this mega-crisis, everyone is looking out for themselves.\n\nIt's pretty brazen of Giorgia Meloni, Italy's far-right prime-minister-in-waiting, and Hungary's anti-EU autocrat Viktor Orban to now claim European — read German — money. Italy announced rescue packages of its own long ago, and is already collecting €200 billion from the COVID-19 recovery fund. Meanwhile, Hungary is still getting cheap gas and oil from Russia while continuing to rage against sanctions. In this crisis, Putin's friend Viktor Orban doesn't deserve a single European cent!\n\nThe economic crisis will come to a head over the coming months if Russia's nonsensical war against Ukraine continues. Pressure will grow on the German finance minister to execute another U-turn and also agree to European debt, with unforeseeable consequences.\n\nThe EU has questions to answer\n\nBut first, European governments should instead focus on buying energy collectively, not outbidding each other in markets gone wild. They should also join forces to do all they can to skim off European corporations' excess profits and redistribute the proceeds. That would be a good start to European solidarity.\n\nIn addition, European leaders must finally grapple with how they would handle a gas or electricity shortage within the borderless single market. What happens if Germany, for instance, a gas transit country, receives too little gas to keep supplying its neighbors?\n\nSuch concrete questions of European solidarity demand that politicians now find real answers. Simply calling on Germany to act as paymaster is no help at all.\n\nThis article has been translated from German.",

Natural gas makes up nearly three-quarters of the country's power generation, and Dhaka has had to impose regular service cuts to conserve electricity.\n\nSome of the power cuts in July lasted up to 13 hours. At least three protesters were killed by security forces during demonstrations about the outages and the rise of the cost of living.\n\nsdi/rt (AFP, Reuters)",
