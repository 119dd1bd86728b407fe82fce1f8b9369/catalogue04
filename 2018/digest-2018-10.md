It presents the TGT along with an Authenticator encrypted with the session key- this proves the client knows the session key returned in the initial authentication exchange (and therefore also contained in the TGT.).. This returns information about all of the cached Kerberos tickets for the specified user logon session... For each bit of ticket information from the cache, build a KERB_RETRIEVE_TKT_REQUEST structure with a message type of KerbRetrieveEncodedTicketMessage, the logon session ID we’re currently iterating over, and the target server (i.e. SPN) of the ticket from the cache we’re iterating over... This returns information about all of the cached Kerberos tickets for the current user’s logon session... For each bit of ticket information from the cache, build a KERB_RETRIEVE_TKT_REQUEST structure with a message type of KerbRetrieveEncodedTicketMessage and the target server (i.e. SPN) of the ticket from the cache we’re iterating over... This means that without elevation, you can not extract usable TGT .kirbis for the current user, as the required session key is nulled... The asktgs action accepts the same /dc:X /ptt parameters as the asktgt... This ticket needs to be a .kirbi representation of a TGT (complete with session key, as described earlier) so we can properly request a service ticket in a TGS-REQ/TGS-REP exchange... C:\Temp\tickets>Rubeus.exe asktgs /ticket:doIFFjCCBRKgAwIBBa...(snip...)== /service:LDAP/primary.testlab.local,cifs/primary.testlab.local /ptt.. Operationally, if you are not elevated and don’t want to stomp on your existing logon session’s TGT by applying a new TGT as described last week, you can request a TGT for a given account and use this blob with asktgs to request/apply just the service tickets needed... The tgtdeleg feature is a re-coded version of Kekeo’s tgt::deleg function, and allows you to extract a usable TGT .kirbi from the current user without elevation on the system... One of these structures contains a forwarded TGT for the current user in a KRB-CRED (.kirbi) structure that’s encrypted within the AP-REQ intended to be sent to the target server... The session key used to encrypt the Authenticator/KRB-CRED is contained within a service ticket for the target SPN that’s cached in an accessible location... This requests a delegate TGT, meaning “The server can use the context to authenticate to other servers as the client.” We also specify a SPN for a server with unconstrained delegation (by default HOST/DC.domain.com) for the pszTargetName... First, a TGS-REQ/TGS-REP exchange occurs to request a service ticket for the SPN we’re pretending to delegate to... This service ticket is stored in the local Kerberos cache, meaning we can later extract the shared session key... The KDC will return this new TGT with a separate session key from the current TGT... The system then uses this forwarded TGT to build an AP-REQ for the target server, where the Authenticator within the request contains the usable KRB-CRED encoding of the forwarded TGT... We can then extract the service ticket session key from the cache and use this to decrypt the Authenticator extracted from the AP-REQ... This would allow you to extract the user’s credential without elevation and keep it alive on another system for reuse, for up to 7 days (by default.).. The AP-REQ message contains the user’s TGT blob, and an Authenticator encrypted with the TGT session key from the TGT .kirbi... If the password set is successful, a KRB-PRIV structure is returned with a result code of 0 (KRB5_KPASSWD_SUCCESS.)..
