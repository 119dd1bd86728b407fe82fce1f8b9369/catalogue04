# Rubeus – Now With More Kekeo

https://blog.harmj0y.net/redteaming/rubeus-now-with-more-kekeo/
<blockquote>
Rubeus, my C# port of some of features from @gentilkiwi‘s Kekeo toolset, already has a few new updates in its 1.1.0 release, and another new feature in its 1.2.0 release. This post will cover the main new features as well as any miscellaneous changes, and will dive a bit into the coolest new features- fake delegation TGTs and Kerberos based password changes.

As before, I want to stress that @gentilkiwi is the originator of these techniques, and this is project is only a reimplementation of his work. If it wasn’t for Kekeo, I would never have been able to figure out these attack components. I’ve found that I don’t truly understand something unless I implement it, hence my continuing march of re-implementing parts of Kekeo. I’ll try my best to explain what’s going on under the hood for the tgt::deleg/tgtdeleg and the misc::changepw/changepw functions (Kekeo and Rubeus) so everyone understands what Benjamin implemented.
