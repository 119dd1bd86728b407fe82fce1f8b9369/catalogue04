Rubeus is a C# Kerberos abuse toolkit that started as a port of @gentilkiwi‘s Kekeo toolset and has continued to evolve since then. For more information on Rubeus, check out the “From Kekeo to Rubeus” release post, the follow up “Rubeus – Now With More Kekeo”, or the recently revamped Rubeus README.md.

I’ve made several recent enhancements to Rubeus, which included me heavily revisiting its Kerberoasting implementation. This resulted in some modifications to Rubeus’ Kerberoasting approach(es) as well as an explanation for some previous “weird” behaviors we’ve seen in the field. Since Kerberoasting is such a commonly used technique, I wanted to dive into detail now that we have a better understanding of its nuances.

If you’re not familiar with Kerberoasting, there’s a wealth of existing information out there, some of which I cover in the beginning of this post. Much of this post won’t make complete sense if you don’t have a base understanding of how Kerberoasting (or Kerberos) works u
