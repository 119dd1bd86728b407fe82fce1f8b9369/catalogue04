# Swiss Cyber Storm 2021 Wrap Up

<blockquote>
On October 12th the Swiss Cyber Storm conference took place in the Kursaal in Bern. Several Compass analysts attended the conference, our security analyst Yves Bieri held a talk and we also had a booth. The conference was great fun, finally a in-person conference with many interesting talks. This blog post wraps up some talks we attended.

Compass Security at SCS 2021
Talk: Patterns and anti-patterns in software development

In this talk Philippe de Ryck talked about helping programmers writing secure code.

The main point made in this presentation is that important security behavior should be encapsulated in libraries. To illustrate this, de Ryck talked about an Apache Pulsar JWT vulnerability. The vulnerability allowed the use of the algorithm “none”. This basically means the JWT is not signed and there are no security guarantees anymore.

Checking the source code of the vulnerable and the fixed version shows that it is not immideatly clear how the vulnerability came to be and why it
