Checking the source code of the vulnerable and the fixed version shows that it is not immideatly clear how the vulnerability came to be and why it is now fixed:     ...      If the JWT library works like this, then such vulnerabilities are bound to happen since in this specific example developers would need to read the source code of the different functions to figure out if algorithm none would be accepted.     ...      Basically the origin of the server, to which the user wants to login, is passed to the authenticator.     ...      Thus, simply relaying the signed challenge will fail since the public key the target server will use to check the signature will not correspond to the private key used for signing.     ...      In this talk Miro Haller talked about /mnt/ain, the Swiss ECSC (european cyber security challenge) team, the team’s journey to the tournament and how the team fared.     ...      In the second phase a 1 day on-site CTF was organized to select the team members who would travel to Prague to participate in the ECSC.     ...      /MNT/AIN at ECSC 2021.     ...
