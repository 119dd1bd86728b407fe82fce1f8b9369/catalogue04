<blockquote>
Agile software development models have become the de-facto standard. They are taught at universities and implemented in practice as far as possible. Anyone who doesn’t develop software using agile processes is on the verge, and already tilting towards that. At least that is how it seems.

Consequently, the question is not whether the integration of penetration testing into the agile environment is feasible, but how we can integrate effective controls into the new, hip, rapid approaches.

Many features, many bugs

With classic software development processes such as waterfall or Rational Unified Process (RUP), penetration testers had to invest lots of time to sift through the numerous changes and understand them. That led, at worst, to another round in the development process to weed out the bugs.

In other words, another delay before the new functionalities finally reached the customer.

Agile FTW

The primary goal of agile methods is to provide benefits to the end user as soon as possi
