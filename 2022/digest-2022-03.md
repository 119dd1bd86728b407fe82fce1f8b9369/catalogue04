During a DFIR (Digital Forensics and Incident Response) Case, we encountered an ESXi Hypervisor that was encrypted by the Ransomware LockBit 2.0. Suspicious SSH logons on the Hypervisor originated from an End-of-Life VPN Appliance (SonicWall SRA 4600). It turns out, this was the initial entry point for the Ransomware attack. Follow us into the forensics analysis of this compromised device.

Finding the Logs

After isolating the VPN Appliance from the Internet and from the internal Network, the customer gave us the credentials for the web based administration interface.

Unfortunately, all log listings in the graphical interfaces were almost empty:

After sifting through all the available features, we found an interesting Tech Support Report feature under System > Diagnostics:

The feature downloads a ZIP file containing interesting logs of the system and an export of its configuration:

status.txt
persist.db.log.1
mcd.log.1
eventlog.1
geoBotD.log.1
tunneld.conf
tunneld.log
