# BloodHound Inner Workings & Limitations – Part 3: Session Enumeration Through Remote Registry & Summary

https://blog.compass-security.com/2022/05/bloodhound-inner-workings-part-3/
<blockquote>
BloodHound is the way to go to for finding attack paths in an Active Directory (AD) environment. However, it is not always clear how the data is gathered without looking at the code of SharpHound, the data ingestor for BloodHound.

Microsoft hardened their systems over time through updates, which makes enumeration of Active Directory (AD) objects and relationships harder than it used to be a couple of years ago.

In this series of articles, we deep dive into the enumeration methods of SharpHound and their limitations.

Table of Contents

In this article, we’ll cover session enumeration through Remote Registry and summarize all our findings. Further articles in this series:

User Rights Enumeration Through SAMR & GPOLocalGroup
Session Enumeration Through NetWkstaUserEnum & NetSessionEnum
Session Enumeration (continued)

Information that proves to be useful during penetration tests is “Who is logged in on which system?”.
