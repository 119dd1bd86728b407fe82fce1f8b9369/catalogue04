Email authentication and security is another complex topic that was often misconfigured in the past.<br> 
Email protections in Office 365 Email authentication<br> 
Email authentication is used to verify if the email server is allowed to send emails on behalf of the sender.<br> 
SPF allows to specify which servers are allowed to send emails for your domain through a DNS record.<br> 
As an example, a message which does not match the SPF policy will have the following headers in O365:<br> 
For instance, a message passing SPF but without DKIM will be rejected due to a DMARC policy could have the following headers in O365:<br> 
In this case Microsoft 365 uses this action when it receives a message that fails the DMARC check from a domain whose DMARC TXT record has a policy of p=reject.<br> 
If this is such a bad idea, why is this even possible?<br> 
Safe senders and domains<br> 
When receiving an email in the junk folder, users can choose to add the sender to the safe senders.<br> 
Spoofed emails from safe senders will be received in the inbox:<br> 
Invalid users in the organization or valid users outside the organization can also be added to the safe sender list, be it in the web or desktop version of outlook:<br> 
Allowed senders and Safe senders are not safe at all!<br> 
On the Outlook desktop client, Safe senders can be disabled by group policy:<br>
