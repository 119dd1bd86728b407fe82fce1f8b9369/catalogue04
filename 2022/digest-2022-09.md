<blockquote>
Disclosure of uninitialized memory is one of the common problems faced when copying data across trust boundaries... The most common bug pattern noticed among these cases is where a structure or union is allocated in memory, and some of the fields or padding bytes are not initialized before copying it across trust boundaries... The question is, is it possible to perform variant analysis of such bugs?..
