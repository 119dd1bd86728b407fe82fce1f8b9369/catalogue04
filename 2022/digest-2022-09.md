Краткое содержание: 

<blockquote>
Disclosure of uninitialized memory is one of the common problems faced when copying data across trust boundaries.<br> 
The most common bug pattern noticed among these cases is where a structure or union is allocated in memory, and some of the fields or padding bytes are not initialized before copying it across trust boundaries.<br> 
The question is, is it possible to perform variant analysis of such bugs?<br>
