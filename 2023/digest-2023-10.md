# P4wnP1 LTE updates

https://sensepost.com/blog/2023/p4wnp1-lte-updates/
<blockquote>
After publishing my blog post about running P4wnP1 on an LTE modem, where I explained how to install Linux and P4wnP1 on an actual LTE modem for sneaky USB attacks, and then trying and failing to do an internal presentation to show it off to folks, I realised that I had not completely documented the process. In the previous post, I also described setting up a Wireguard VPN to an Internet-accessible host, and then using SSH to access the modem over that VPN. Furthermore, when the WiFi link was up, and Wireguard was routing over WiFi, I had no problems running the same commands. What is MTU, though? I used this with an ever decreasing packet size to try and figure out what the MTU of my LTE interface was. It was defaulted to something like 1500, but to my surprise, I got all the way down to an ICMP data size of 996 before I was able to successfully get an ICMP response back. After setting the LTE MTU to 1024, I was able to successfully establish the Wireguard VPN, and SSH connection over LTE, and execute all the commands that were failing previously. This is because the MTU is only effective in a single direction, for packets SENT from the system, and doesn’t affect the size of packets received. Wireguard works just fine over LTE with an MTU of 1420. It was looking for libcomposite in lsmod output, and trying to modprobe libcomposite if it was not found. Knowing that P4wnP1 is very old code, and that I had trouble trying to build it in the past, on top of having near zero Golang experience, I contemplated papering over it by making shims for lsmod that would return the expected output even if libcomposite was a builtin and not a module. After a few iterations trying to figure out why my changes didn’t solve the problem, I realised that the output of rmmod libcomposite was on stderr, not stdout, and corrected my code. Unfortunately, mac80211_hwsim is not currently compiled for the OpenStick, so I can’t do this. For the OpenStick, the LTE interface is available. My solution was to instruct NetworkManager not to try and manage the WiFi interface when P4wnP1 is running, using a systemd service configuration option: I ran the following commands to download my HID to TCP proxy, install golang on the OpenStick, and build and run it:
