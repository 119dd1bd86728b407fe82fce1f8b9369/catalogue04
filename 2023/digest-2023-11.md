Opening BSides Cape Town 2023 is @singe with a Keynote “Impose Cost: Our defences eventually fail and we need to take the fight to the criminals” where he will argue that the only way to effectively and realistically succeed in defending our networks is to take the challenge to the real criminals and not just wait for them to come. Be sure to come and visit the machine to learn how to hack it to win some prizes!
