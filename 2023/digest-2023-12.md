Yet, the reality was very different. In her HR role, Bonny conveyed that Kristina had recommended me for the job. Skepticism arose when I discovered Kristina had used the WhatsApp alias “Ava.” To address my doubts, Bonny presented a screenshot of her chat with Ava (or Kristina), leading to an unforeseen twist. Shortly afterward, Bonny presented me with the so-called job, which was, in reality, the scam. Following the process, I sent her a screenshot as directed and already had 20 USDT in my digital wallet to kickstart my work. She then gave instructions for a straightforward process: My main task was to activate the work wizard by choosing “Launch Evolution” and clicking “Evolve” for the listed apps. The Illusion of Executive Applications She informed me that she would withdraw the entire balance from the training account, which she had financed. To continue working, I had to contact customer service and provide my training account’s username. Bonny even disclosed her daily earnings, fostering a sense of camaraderie. During my engagement, Bonny took on various roles. In addition, I changed the withdrawal wallet address to my own before Bonny had the opportunity to empty the training account. And everything Bonny had shown me was fake, with not a single dollar ever being transferred during my training. The crucial factor is in the training phase, where the guide convincingly shows that the system not only works but also brings in profits. What’s interesting about this psychological manipulation is that it not only gives the illusion of making money but also triggers a surge of positive emotions. If you approach the scam with skepticism, it’s easy to lose that doubt during the training and start believing that it works. That’s exactly what the scammers want—to make you believe in the illusion of success, prompting you to deposit money into your account and unintentionally lose it. But for those who have fallen into this or a similar trap, it’s crucial to contact the relevant authorities and law enforcement for help. As the virtual world keeps advancing, so should our awareness, skepticism, and ability to bounce back. It serves as evidence of the dynamics between the virtual and the real, and a reminder that, in our digital age, it’s not just our passwords that require protection, but our understanding and suspicion as well.

<blockquote>
But in the history of competitive endeavours nobody has won by playing defence alone. We have this idea that we can wrap our users and systems in enough padding to protect them in a world where guns exist. We’ve leaned so hard into this idea that we’re on the floor and it’s time to look up.

<blockquote>
That is, giving back more than you take. And by giving back I don’t mean *just* doing research or writing tools. In my talk, “your contributions, today” I reflected on a current view of practical security research and contributions in a time of ever-increasing systems complexity, abstractions and Instagram reels.
