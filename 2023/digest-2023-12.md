Yet, the reality was very different.<br> 
In her HR role, Bonny conveyed that Kristina had recommended me for the job.<br> 
Skepticism arose when I discovered Kristina had used the WhatsApp alias “Ava.” To address my doubts, Bonny presented a screenshot of her chat with Ava (or Kristina), leading to an unforeseen twist.<br> 
Shortly afterward, Bonny presented me with the so-called job, which was, in reality, the scam.<br> 
Following the process, I sent her a screenshot as directed and already had 20 USDT in my digital wallet to kickstart my work.<br> 
She then gave instructions for a straightforward process: My main task was to activate the work wizard by choosing “Launch Evolution” and clicking “Evolve” for the listed apps.<br> 
The Illusion of Executive Applications<br> 
She informed me that she would withdraw the entire balance from the training account, which she had financed.<br> 
To continue working, I had to contact customer service and provide my training account’s username.<br> 
Bonny even disclosed her daily earnings, fostering a sense of camaraderie.<br> 
During my engagement, Bonny took on various roles.<br> 
In addition, I changed the withdrawal wallet address to my own before Bonny had the opportunity to empty the training account.<br> 
And everything Bonny had shown me was fake, with not a single dollar ever being transferred during my training.<br> 
The crucial factor is in the training phase, where the guide convincingly shows that the system not only works but also brings in profits.<br> 
What’s interesting about this psychological manipulation is that it not only gives the illusion of making money but also triggers a surge of positive emotions.<br> 
If you approach the scam with skepticism, it’s easy to lose that doubt during the training and start believing that it works.<br> 
That’s exactly what the scammers want—to make you believe in the illusion of success, prompting you to deposit money into your account and unintentionally lose it.<br> 
But for those who have fallen into this or a similar trap, it’s crucial to contact the relevant authorities and law enforcement for help.<br> 
As the virtual world keeps advancing, so should our awareness, skepticism, and ability to bounce back.<br> 
It serves as evidence of the dynamics between the virtual and the real, and a reminder that, in our digital age, it’s not just our passwords that require protection, but our understanding and suspicion as well.<br>

<blockquote>
Remote RPC Attacks – Detection Remote RPC Attacks – Prevention Components of the RPC Firewall Create an RPC Filter/Firewall rule Identify UUID and Operation number of an RPC call Identifying allowed endpoints Identifying possible actions Checking the current status of the Local Security Authority (LSA) Protection Check by using the registry Rule creation with LSA Protection enabled (RPC filters) Rule creation with LSA Protection disabled (Firewall) Deployment References Steffen Rogge Why should we care?<br> 
When the RPC firewall configuration is configured to audit, RPC events are written to the Windows Event Log and allow for a forward to a central detection and analysis platform.<br> 
The rpcFwManager.exe is the main executable that is being used by the RPC Firewall service in the deployment but is also used to reload the changed configuration.<br> 
The file rpcMessages.dll is a common library file used for logic that is shared between the other components and responsible for creating and writing the events to the Windows Event log.<br> 
In order to create a rule we do need the UUID for the affected interface and we can find that information here:<br> 
This also means that we do not want our RPC firewall to block legitimate RPC calls and thus prevent the DCSync and cause problems in our production environment.<br> 
In order to archieve this, we will be using the actions “allow” and “deny” as well as the audit setting “true”.<br> 
Because the RPC Firewall protection interacts with the LSASS process on the server it is deployed on, we first have to identify if LSA Protection is enabled in order to decide if our rule set will be based on RPC filters or the RPC firewall rules.<br> 
The parameter “sid” is one of the Microsoft built-in security identifiers, which can be be found in an overview under the following URL: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthz/sid-strings<br> 
As “BA” should not be allowed in order to prevent local administrators from using DCSync on the target and “SY” should be allowed in order to allow the local system or machine account to call the RPC endpoint successfully.<br> 
In order to allow the DCSync from domain controllers and audit the calls we will set the two following rules:<br>

<blockquote>
In this blog post we will take a look at the health monitoring capabilities for log ingestion in Microsoft Sentinel.<br> 
The log collection is done via the Azure Monitor Agent (AMA) or the Log Analytics Agent (MMA).<br> 
Microsoft provides two out-of-the-box features to perform health monitoring on the data connectors: The Data connectors health monitoring workbook & SentinelHealth data table.<br> 
Using the Data connectors health monitoring workbook<br> 
The Data collection health monitoring workbook is an out-of-the-box solution that provides insight regarding the log ingestion status, detection of anomalies and the health status of the Log Analytics agents.<br> 
SampleInterval: Define the time interval in which data is sampled in the defined time range.<br> 
Each time sample gets an anomaly score, which is used for the detection.<br> 
The SentinelHealth data table<br> 
For the data connectors, there are two types of events: Data fetch status change & Data fetch failure summary.<br> 
The Data fetch status change events contain the status of the data fetching and additional information.<br> 
These events will be logged once an hour if the status is stable (i.e. status doesn’t change from Success to Failure and vice versa).<br> 
For the first example, we’ll setup an alert in the Log Analytics workspace where Sentinel is running on.<br> 
The alert logic will run on a recurring basis and alert the necessary people when it is triggered.<br> 
For starters, we’ll go the the Log Analytics Workspace and and start the creation of a new alert.<br> 
Select Custom log search for the signal and we’ll use the Connector status change from Success to Failure query example as logic.<br> 
For the second example, we’ll create a Logic App that will send an overview via Teams of all the tables with an anomalous score.<br> 
The query is based on the logic from the Data Connector Workbook.<br> 
The combination of the two out-of-the-box solutions and the flexibility to create custom monitoring solutions, makes Microsoft Sentinel a comprehensive and adaptable choice for managing and monitoring security events.<br>

But in the history of competitive endeavours nobody has won by playing defence alone.<br> 
We have this idea that we can wrap our users and systems in enough padding to protect them in a world where guns exist.<br> 
We’ve leaned so hard into this idea that we’re on the floor and it’s time to look up.<br>

That is, giving back more than you take.<br> 
And by giving back I don’t mean *just* doing research or writing tools.<br> 
In my talk, “your contributions, today” I reflected on a current view of practical security research and contributions in a time of ever-increasing systems complexity, abstractions and Instagram reels.<br>

In CrowdStrike, this is called Real Time Response, and it provides a wide range of capabilities, from executing built-in commands like ipconfig and netstat to running your own PowerShell scripts.<br> 
I’ll also be providing the code for the threat hunting script, and by the end of this blog you will be able to use the script to pull registry run keys, scheduled tasks, WMI subscriptions, startup folder files, and services from multiple machines, to uncover hidden persistence mechanisms.<br> 
Before interacting with CrowdStrike’s Oauth2 API via PSFalcon, you will need PowerShell installed and a valid API client (which consists of a ClientID and a secret), that you can create via this link https://falcon.crowdstrike.com/api-clients-and-keys/clients.<br> 
runscript: To run a PowerShell script Arguments: the Base64 commands about to be executed Timeout: timeout limit Group_ID: The ID of the host group<br> 
With that done, you are ready to run it via the command line.<br> 
In this blog post, we looked into how the PSFalcon module can be leveraged in order to execute multiple commands in a group of hosts in CrowdStrike for threat hunting purposes.<br> 
Identify persistence via registry run keys in a host with a crypto miner infection, which was not detected by the CrowdStrike agent since it was a pre-sensor malware infection and the host had not been rebooted in order for a detection to have triggered.<br> 
All in all, this code and the methodology presented could be modified to execute any PowerShell command in a group of hosts, so feel free to experiment with your own commands, whether it is threat hunting, system hardening or whatever else you want to do.<br>
