<blockquote>
If a laptop is lost or stolen, an attacker who gains physical possession of the machine cannot access the data or tamper with the system, even when removing the disk and accessing it from another system.<br> 
BitLocker Configuration<br> 
In the TPM-only mode, the Volume Master Key (VMK) is released during boot and sent to the CPU.<br> 
This gives an attacker the opportunity to sniff the data channel and intercept the VMK.<br> 
TPM: In the TPM-only mode, the user is not required to provide a protector to unlock the TPM.<br> 
During boot, the boot environment is measured, meaning that the firmware and software that is loaded is tracked and the measurement values are stored in the Platform Configuration Registers (PCR).<br> 
TPM and PIN: The VMK is only released to the CPU after the user has provided the correct PIN.<br> 
TPM and Startup Key: The VMK is only released to the CPU after the user has provided the correct startup key.<br> 
Attack<br> 
The goal of the attack is to sniff the communication between the TPM chip and the CPU.<br> 
Afterwards, the BitLocker recovery key can be obtained with the Sigrok BitLocker Key Extractor tool:<br> 
This section discusses various mitigation strategies as well as operational considerations that require attention in practice.<br> 
Recall from a previous section that the attack exploits the fact that in TPM-only mode the VMK is automatically released and sent to the CPU during boot, allowing the attacker to recover it by sniffing the bus communication.<br> 
If tamper protection is detected, the system will either prompt the user for the BIOS password or the BitLocker recovery key during the next boot cycle.<br> 
Naturally, it cannot be guaranteed that the PIN can be kept secret, and a motivated attacker might very well be able to learn it through several means.<br> 
An attacker in possession of the PIN can carry out the same attack as described in the previous section, with the only exception that they have to enter the PIN during boot to release the VMK.<br> 
Depending on the environment or the type of adversary, the most secure BitLocker configuration might not offer adequate protection.<br>
