Краткое содержание: 

<blockquote>
Depending on the network restrictions in place, attackers could gain full network level access to a compromised environment through the network tunneling capabilities embedded in the SparkTar backdoor.<br> 
The findings of our investigation have been independently corroborated by the research performed by Mandiant and have partially been observed by Fortinet.<br> 
By sharing these insights it is the goal of NVISO to allow for organizations to get an understanding on the capabilities and inner workings of the backdoors, as well as enhancing their security posture and resilience against these evolving advanced cyber threats.<br>
